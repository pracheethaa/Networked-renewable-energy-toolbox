USA,Wind,"DO RENEWABLE PPAS PROVIDE THE SAME SUPPORT TOWARD MEETING NIPSCOâ€™S PEAK SYSTEM DEMAND AS NIPSCOâ€™S TRANSMISSION AND CONVENTIONAL GENERATION FACILITIES?To an extent, yes. However, the issue is that renewable facilities cannot be counted on to the same extent as transmission facilities and conventional generation facilities to support NIPSCOâ€™s peak system demand. Transmission facilities, since they are passive in nature and typically have a very low forced outage rate, have a very high availability of nearly 100% at the time of peak system demand. Conventionalgeneration facilities, due to their fuel arrangements and having equivalent forcedoutage rates typically in the range of 5 to 25%,have an availability 75 to 95% of theirsummer rated MW capability at the time of peak system demand. In contrast, the most recent studies by NIPSCOâ€™s Regional Transmission Organization (â€œRTOâ€) show that, on a MISO-wide basis, wind generation facilities on average can be expected to have an availability of approximately 15.2% of their nameplate MW rating at the time of peak system demand and solar generation facilities can be expected to have an availability of approximately 50% of their nameplate capability at the time of peak system demand. Therefore, with respect to supporting peak system demand, a nameplate MW of wind generation capacity on average provides approximately 16 to 20% of the same support that would be provided by a summer rated capability MW of conventional generation. Similarly, a nameplate MW of solar generation capacity on average provides approximately 53 to 67% of the same support toward meeting peak demand that would be provided by a summer rated capability MW of conventional generation. Given this, a minimum of 16% of the total cost of wind PPAs and a minimum 53% of the total cost of solar PPAs should be allocated to customer classes on the same basis as the fixedcosts of conventional generating facilities.Testimony from Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission hearing for cause #45194 NIPSCO,Rosewater wind in 2019.",NEUTRAL,infrastructure

Further, MISO projects that, as wind penetration increases, the ELCC of wind resources will fall from the current 15.2% towards 12.5%.WHAT UCAP DOES WIND IN INDIANA RECEIVE?As shown in Figure 1 below, wind in Indiana only received 7.4%.

> This week Le Monde reported that the government asked EDF, the country&#039;s main state-controlled energy company, to work up plans to build three new nuclear plants, each with a pair of its EPR reactors.

> French nuclear regulators pushed for safety upgrades to existing plants, and in 2015 the government voted to cut the share of nuclear in the nation&#039;s energy supply to 50% by 2025.In recent years, the nuclear industry has struggled in general amid safety concerns, rising competition from natural gas and renewables, and high-profile development boondoggles.

> So building six reactors wouldn&#039;t necessarily increase the share of electricity produced by nuclear plants across the nation, particularly as demand increases in the coming years.

Nuclear power is the only form of ""cleaner"" energy that can realistically compete with coal power plants and other similar fossil fuel power sources. The design failures you mentioned are extremely rare and because of the amount of danger that a malfunction poses, more failsafes and precautions are put in place on nuclear reactors than anything else in the world.

France,Nuclear,"The future is fission. :) Fusion is perpetually decades away from even functioning at all, let alone being used in a commercial power plant.  Fission exists now, has for decades, and is a fantastic power source.

As for separating nuclear power and weapons, it's a viable position.  There are even states like North Korea that have a nuclear weapons program and no nuclear power. (Bomb grade uranium can be produced without a nuclear reactor just fine using centrifuge isotope separation.)",NEGATIVE,financial_constraints
France,Nuclear,"When it comes to fusion — in the 1970s there was research on inertial confinement for power production, but most everything since that time has been directed to understanding and modelling the phenomena of thermonuclear explosions, in the context of a world in which the international political order is based on nuclear deterrence, but actually testing the weapons is largely taboo. To some extent, that's not about what the physicists want to do, but about what they can get funding for. But it's also true that getting power out of an ICF system is at least as difficult as getting it out of a magnetic-confinement system. When people start talking seriously about porous ceramic walls weeping liquid lithium, and about 99% recovery of unburned tritium, it should be clear that the engineering challenges are such that we shouldn't expect a practical, economic powerplant any time soon.

Now, when it comes to fission, the key thing to realize is that, yes, there is some overlap between the technology required for power and the technology required for bombs. But if you look at any of the countries which have actually built bombs, you will see that none of them have used nuclear power plants or fuel-cycle facilities built for civil purposes to get to that point. To the contrary : Britain, after building its first bombs using plutonium from the Windscale piles, built Calder Hall and Chapelcross to make weapons plutonium with electricity as a by-product, and then operated those plants for decades as pure power-producers. Similarly, the British enrichment plant was originally built to provide weapons material, and then switched over to civil fuel.

In most cases, countries which have built bombs did so before they built power plants ; China is an extreme example. And in Pakistan, although the CANDU-type Karachi power plant was operating for many years before an attempt was made to build a bomb, that bomb used highly enriched uranium from clandestine centrifuges.

Honestly, if you ask me about the link between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, I'll tell you that the only time nuclear weapons have been used in war was in a war that started over control of oil supplies. The longer we allow control of fossil fuels to dominate world politics, the more chances there are that someone will decide to use nuclear weapons. You certainly can't eliminate nuclear weapons by banning civil fission power.",NEGATIVE,infrastructure
France,Nuclear,"I don't find it complicated anymore. I'm pro water, but anti-waterboarding or drowning people. I'm pro-fire, but anti fire-bombing cities.  Really it's kind of a classic ""it's not the poisonit's  the dose"".",NEUTRAL,financial_constraints
France,Nuclear,"Yo, forget about fusion for a moment because it is off the table at least for the next 100 years. Lets talk about fission insted, which we have and use. Enriched uranium follows mainly 4 enrichment levels. You need enriched uranium to do both fuel and bombs, being that they follow the principle of chain reaction (tho inside a reactor it is controlled, while in a bomb it is purposefully not), this is very very simplified.

Natural Uranium: ≈99.3% 238U which is stable, ≈0.7% 235U which is radioactive

Low Enriched Uranium: 3-5% 235U

Highly Enriched Uranium: up to 20% 235U

Military Grade Uranium: >85% 235U

This means basically that a reactor could never explode as a bomb, in fact it never happened and the worst case scenario is the melting of the core and the emission outside of radionuclides and radiation (extremely rare).",NEGATIVE,infrastructure
France,Nuclear,"I'm not really sure what you're asking here. 

Firstly, what are you talking about with Nuclear Power Plants producing fallout?  I'm sure you meant another word, as they most certainly do not produce fallout. 

What I gather you're talking about it reusing spent fuel to be put in some sort of battery?  

This technology does exist, they're called Betavoltaic Batteries, they use beta emissions from decaying particles.  They arnt very efficient and would need a lot of them to be even remotely usable. 

With that said, Spent Nuclear Fuel does still contain A LOT of energy, but trying to cupture any radiation it produces is rather pointless.  Even trying to heat water or some other medium with this decay heat just isn't worth it. 

Realistically, reprocessing this fuel is our best option currently, which some countries actually do, allowing it to be re-used.  Or we could deploy fast/breeder reactors that can use this spent fuel and produce usable fuel for current reactor types.",POSITIVE,infrastructure

From what I can tell from this brief skim, this has all the hallmarks of a safe PWR. Active and passive safety systems, double containment, etc.

France,Nuclear,"Points 2 and 4 to 7 are totally invalid, as they relate to the supposed dangers of nuclear power. Nuclear is and has always been the safest of any energy source we have.

**More people have died from installing solar panels than have died from nuclear disasters.** For every TWh of energy produced, 0.04 people die from nuclear power, and about 155,000TWh of energy is produced globally every year.  That means in a year, only **6200 people die** from **nuclear energy** production, **68200 people** **die** from falling off rooftops while installing **solar panels**, and **15,500,000 die** from **coal** mining and air pollution  [(I got the figures from this site)]( Nuclear power beats every other source in deaths per TWh produced.

Here I address the points in that article:

* 2. The cost would soon be outweighed by the amount of energy it can produce. It is much cheaper than other renewables.
* 4. Meltdowns happen extremely rarely and usually aren't much of a danger due modern technology.
* 5. The mining is much safer than coal, no humans actually go into uranium mines, acid is flushed down pipes to dissolve the uranium.
* 6. I haven't really look into the CO2 cost of nuclear plants, but I can guarantee that the ratio between the energy it produced and its CO2 cost is better than most of the other sources.
* 7. The waste from nuclear power is only a few meters cubed, compare that to the literal kilometres cubed of CO2 we dump into the atmosphere from fossil fuels. Solar panels take up huge amounts of area to produce little energy and hydroelectricity requires vast amounts of land to be flooded.

Nuclear power is the **most practical energy source** we can use to prevent a climate disaster in the next century. Other renewables  are too costly, take up too much area and are often inconsistent.

All the claims that wind and solar are way cheaper than nuclear are dependent on KW/H production. On pure numbers it looks fine from the outside. They produce twice as much KW/H per dollar!

Problem is, this doesn't account for the fact that the sun doesn't shine half the day, and the wind isn't blowing all the time.

Yeah, on pure KW/H, solar is cheaper. The sun also doesn't shine at night time. So you have to take that into account by roughly doubling whatever estimate you have for your solar cost.

France,Nuclear,"Renewables are the future.  Oil, coal, and fissionable material will eventually run out regardless of the vested interests and the politicians they influence (own).

The problem is that renewables can't support our current lifestyles (pun not intended but welcomed), so we have to make a choice as to what will fill the gaps until they take over.  If we go with coal and/or natural gas, in 20 to 50 years when renewables own the day, we can mothball the old plants and move on.

If we go with nuclear, in 20 to 50 years we can mothball the old plants and then spend considerable resources dealing with the tons and tons of deadly nuclear waste.

There's also the complacency factor.  You really want to shut down coal as soon as possible because it's dumping carbon into the air, so there's motivation to get things done with clean energy sources.

With nuclear, you kind of forget about it until something goes horribly, horribly wrong as things have a way of eventually doing.  Nuclear advocates claim how the next generation of plants are so much better than the previous generation that they're virtually fail-safe.  I'm sure if we had access to the debates on nuclear from 40 years ago, they would have said the exact same thing.

When Fukushima and Chernobyl were built, I doubt you'll find experts from the time saying that, while these plants are a little dodgy, the ones coming in forty years will be perfectly safe.  No, they said those old plants were perfectly safe *then* the same way they're saying the new ones are now. (And they were mostly right, just as their future predictions will be *mostly* right.)

Lastly, old energy won't suddenly just disappear.  It will likely linger on for decades as a backup source of power.  Of coal, gas, oil, and nuclear sitting there rusting away, it's easy to see how the first three are preferable to the last (if you're reasonably objective).",NEUTRAL,infrastructure

France,Nuclear,This again. Who is it on Reddit who uses negative prices as a scare tactic on a weekly basis?,NEUTRAL,technological_shortcomings
France,Nuclear,"So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

First, reactors can be shut down almost instantaneously. This is for safety. They do keep producing about 8% of their heat though after shut down for about a day. This is removed by, usually, just bleeding steam to the turbine generators, but there are backup methods to this, again, for safety.

A small-ish portion of a nuclear power plant's daily operating cost comes from fuel consumption. A huge portion of the daily operating cost for fossil fuel plants come from fuel consumption. So it's not very cost effective to shut down a nuclear reactor.

As for how long it takes to start up and shut down nuclear plants, it does take awhile if you want to avoid emergency methods. But this is something that was designed in to allow the plants to operate with lower enrichment and large size. If you have a plant designed differently, like with a smaller size, this allows rapid changes in load. Rapid changes in load may become more desired now that renewables are a wide-scale thing. This allows nuclear plants to quickly adapt to changing demand profiles caused by wind and solar variations while still keeping energy green.

Basically, small size nuclear plants are a green solution to make up for the gaps needed to be filled by changing renewable power production.

As for the excess power produced. France just needs to invite companies in that have needs for energy but can take advantage of low grid demand. For example, turning seawater into pure water is energy intensive, but you could only switch those on during peak solar hours. Same thing for producing H2 and O2 gas from H2O. Same thing for producing cryogenic liquids. Same thing for smelting metals (although, I'm not 100% sure about that one).

France,Nuclear,"It really isn't confounding at all and Bryan Walsh might know the reasons why if he actually did some investigation.

Precious little space has been given to the detailed reasons *why* the German government is going down this path but there is one quote which alludes to why this is happening;

>“The gas storage tanks must be full by winter,” Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister and a member of the Green Party, said in June. “That is our top priority.”

The plan here is to quickly recommission some coal-fired power plants to temporarily take over from gas-fired plants so that the gas can be used for heating.

The key words there being 'quickly' and 'temporary'. 

You don't just pop down to the local nuclear reactors and mash the ""on"" switch but you can much more quickly get a coal plant up and running. Important when you have a very hard deadline approaching. They can't wait years to get nuclear plants running for a problem which is already happening (gas supplies from the Nord are already off).

The other aspect is 'temporary'. This is just to take load off the operating gas power plants to get through winter and the desire is to shut them off just as quickly. Easy with coal.

Also worth considering the amounts of energy we are discussing. 

Energy from operating gas plants contribute around 89.0 bilion kWh / year (15% of gross energy production). A fair bit greater than the 69.0b kWh from nuclear but a *fraction* of the 236.7b kWh from renewables.

Nobody likes coal, coal is the worst. But in this extreme case the options are limited and coal is sadly the most viable option right now - but it isn't the only option.

What doesn't get reported in low-rate articles like this is that Germany has also brought forward their renewable target of 100% by 2035, and all onshore renewables capacity targets for 2030 have been increased (Nov 2021, ""Easter Package"").

(Bloomberg) -- France faces “substantial” costs and technical challenges if it wants to replace almost all its aging nuclear plants with renewable energy by 2050, the International Energy Agency and the country’s grid operator said Wednesday.

In a report commissioned by the French government, the IEA and Reseau de Transport d’Electricite highlight the need to scale up new technologies and adapt the legal framework to ensure that a network dominated by variable wind and solar generation remains reliable at all times.

The government is targeting a power mix that’s about 35% wind and solar in 2035, up from about 10% last year. While the grid can cope with that, France will need more backup production and energy storage if that share is going to expand much further, the report showed. The country must also consider potential public opposition to large wind and solar farms and new power lines.

“All the costs associated with a high share of renewables, including the costs of storage, demand-side flexibility” and grid development, “might be substantial in France after 2035,” the IEA and RTE said in the report.

State-controlled Electricite de France SA currently has 56 nuclear power stations in operation, with a production capacity of 61 gigawatts, typically producing almost three-quarters of the country’s output. It plans to shut a dozen plants by 2035, and most of the rest by 2050.

While President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of building new reactors to replace some of those retiring, he has deferred a decision until after 2022’s presidential election. Some opposition parties, such as the Greens, are against new atomic plants, pointing to rising costs at EDF’s current nuclear projects in France and the U.K., as well as environmental risks associated with operating the the generators and storing spent fuel.",NEUTRAL,financial_constraints

France,Nuclear,"I definitely *wouldn't* rule out nuclear as an option for future energy generation.

The best argument I've heard suggests that nuclear capacity should be maintained at its current rate. In other words, new nuclear reactors should only be built to replace old reactors that close down. This should help maintain uranium reserves, although as the supply of uranium becomes less plentiful and harder to extract the cost of using it will go up. It also should help finding suitable sites for new stations, since in many cases they can be built in the same location as the reactor they're due to replace.

Most of the problems with nuclear - safety risks, waste disposal, construction over-runs - are engineering problems that have known solutions. Unfortunately, these solutions don't come cheap. However, putting in place a suitable renewable energy network that can handle baseload demand could be similarly expensive. Nuclear generation will benefit from the rising cost of carbon (just as renewables will) and may be a more attractive option in the next few years.

In the UK, the Scottish parliament has ruled out building any new nuclear reactors. This makes sense, since Scotland has ample opportunity for wind, wave and tidal energy generation. A big majority of the UK's renewable energy targets are likely to come from Scotland. The south of the country is less fortunate, and it also happens to be where energy demand is highest. Siting new nuclear stations close to areas of high demand will mean fewer transmission losses. Unfortunately, that means more additional costs due to the higher land value.

A few caveats. Before any new nuclear reactors are built, a thorough study should be done of all the costs (and emissions) involved over the entire life cycle of the plant, especially with regards to decomissioning old reactors. This will allow a fair and honest comparison to be made between nuclear power and the alternatives. Plans should be in place for suitable disposal of waste - most of the UKs nuclear waste is still in temporary storage waiting permanent storage in a facility that has yet to get off the drawing board, which is a disgrace.

Although I'd put wind, solar, hydro and tidal energy before nuclear given the choice, I've a feeling that the shift in thinking to enable our emissions targets to be met will be too much to rely on renewables alone. Even though you're not looking to make the comparison with coal power, there may not turn out to be much choice.

For any energy system based on renewables there is inherent intermittency in energy production. The way our current energy system is set up, demand and supply need to be matched at all times in order to avoid wide scale outages. In order to mitigate the intermittency, we need energy generation that is easy to ramp production up or down, for example nuclear or gas. In essence you could use other ""burnable"" energy carriers, e.g. hydrogen, but those are still produced from natural gas, so that will only ensure efficiency losses.

Now long term nuclear is a very good option to perform this task, however, there is nearly not enough nuclear capacity in Europe to cover all of the variability, thus we need some other source. For this purpose, gas is the best option as of now.

So why name it green, well that's just a policy decision, to make it possible to keep investing in gas based power generation. No one actually believes gas is green.

Safety is critical, of course, but common sense is severely lacking and the regulations need serious updating and streamlining to be practical. 

Small example: we built millions of dollars of assemblies for a nuclear fuel fabrication facility. We had a lot of involvement with auditors and inspectors to be sure everyone was done perfectly. Our suppliers were audited and an extensive paper trail was created to validate the origin and traceability of every component, down to a screw. Every assembly was thoroughly tested and documented - even on video. Every mechanical connection and electrical termination was torqued and recorded no matter how insignificant. So far, no problems with that. But then, when everything was traced, torqued, and tested, they couldn't be used without ""third party validation."" What this means, was that every completed assembly was shipped to a warehouse, every termination was undone, every wire and device removed, and it was completely disassembled. Traceability of each component was confirmed, simply by using the purchase orders and certificates of authenticity they we *already* compiled, without further verification (in other words, if we had forged anything, they'd have no clue anyway). After that they'd have to put everything back together, and hire someone (not us) to torque everything back to the specifications we created (where MFR specs weren't available) and documented already. That ""service"" of undoing and redoing what we'd already done was about 4 times the cost of us engineering and building them in the first place, and took at least 3 times as long (years later they were still asking us questions). And they weren't as skilled or capable as us, so all they did was create problems that didn't exist when we shipped the product. A decade later, the facility isn't operational and the projected cost has increased by billions, if it's ever finished. It could have been completed for a fraction of the cost, just as safely if not moreso because you wouldn't have people taking apart assemblies they aren't qualified to build in the first place.",POSITIVE,infrastructure

The cherry on top is that they want to process nuclear waste. This is from their website: "" In the CMSR (Compact Molten Salt Reactor), the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant. This provides significant safety benefits.

If the fuel salt should ever come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and turn into solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself.

The reactor will operate at near-atmospheric pressures and cannot overheat due to a frozen salt plug, that melt and drain the core to cooled tanks before damage can occur.""

1. Modern plants built in non-seismically active places are very safe. But they are safe because they are designed with an enormous amount of security and safeguards. As a result, they are expensive to build and take a long time to build and plan.

2. Nuclear waste is still a thing. Nuclear plants generate a lot of low level nuclear waste and a small amount of high level nuclear waste, some of which can have half-lives in the millions of years. There are a lot of ideas for getting rid of this waste, but the first long term disposal facilities are just starting to come online and they amount to “Dig a really deep hole, fill it with spent fuel rods, and close it up and don’t dig there for another million years.” Most nuclear waste today is stored in big metal drums out behind the nuclear plant.

In the end, IAEA (united nation agency that promotes nuclear worldwide) estimates that there will be no more than 12% of nuclear in the electric mix worldwide, and it's extremely optimistic.   
If you check scenarios from the IPCC or IEA, you'll see that nuclear is expected to deliver a really small % of power compared to renewables (mainly solar and wind for electricity and biomass for the rest).

France,Nuclear,"I spent my career working in nuclear power and would like to respond to these comments but separately if possible. My background and expertise is radiation safety. 

Why do you say plants built in the 70/80s suck? To remain in operation they are constantly updating and if they cannot meet current safety requirements they won’t be allowed to operate through the end of their license to operate. 

The computer in our pocket would have done nothing to mitigate Chernobyl which resulted from plant staff deliberately circumventing safety systems to see how the plant would react to a condition that relied on turbine driven safety systems which are not primary for that purpose and when they realized they had an overheating core dumped cold water in that resulted in a steam and chemical reaction, not nuclear, that blew the lid off 

TMI wouldn’t have happened if operating staff hadn’t shut off a safety system because they had not been properly trained and plant instruments suggested a different issue. 

Currently the REGinna NPP near Rochester, NY, is the oldest in the country (>40 years operating) operating safely 

The cost to build has always been an issue but many problems didn’t arise from bad designs but from poorly constructed things. Early in my career, for example, plants were required to perform inspections on hangars used to support safety related systems. What happened was when drilling into rebar reinforced concrete the drill would not advance the depth required by the design and pipe fitters would cut off the end to not need to drill a new hole and fix the one in the wrong places. Shortened anchors didn’t meet specifications and plants were down until they were fixed. Not bad design but construction quality control was the issue. There are many instances I could convey. 

So the public only hears plants are down (unreliable) without understanding the real issue which is companies trying to compete in spite of not being spec. (Catch me if you can)

France Nationalized nuclear power and the US Navy doesn’t have the budget constraints commercial plants have so it’s a good comparison. 

And as to our expertise. Very few US companies have recent experience and staff in USA but training, education and staffing is far easier than fabrication of key components. Need a new reactor head? Probably a few years from ordering to delivery. 

Please feel free to ask questions. 

What’s the perverse incentives issue?",NEGATIVE,infrastructure
France,Nuclear,"Actually there are some pretty good nuclear plants that have been running for like half a century in the US. You could just build the same freaking design and be fine. Of course you could also add 50 years of experience in engineering and add some passive safety, but safety is not the reason they are not build.

Every MW of nuclear in the US takes like 6.000 usd to build. In South Korea is less than 2.500 usd/MW

The thing in the US is that nuclear evolved in a era where energy utilities where paid fixed return over their costs, both operational and investments. This made some incentives to first not run plants in the most efficient way but also it meant that the costlier your investment, the bigger return you could get. So building nuclear became a headache because that was the way to maximize your utilities.

Also, nuclear lags against renewables in how easy it is to finance the latter. Even a household can pay a few solar panels, and you can scale it to the size of any pocket. Nuclear can only be built by massive companies with state backing and assurances. This plus the fact US energy market doesn't have the interest to fix the perverse incentives issue facing nuclear means its not going to go anywhere as fast as its needed to make a dent in the climate change issue. I could be wrong, if tomorrow everyone wakes up loving nuclear and you lift a rock and find 10.000 nuclear engineers ready to make the nuclear renaissance it could happen and could make sense, but also you have to consider that nuclear by itself is also not a great match for renewables as its not great at following variable of wind and solar",NEGATIVE,infrastructure

Nuclear has provided 20% of US power for decades. All of the spent fuel from that entire history would fit in a Walmart.

There has never been a death, injury, or, as far as I know, any actual ecological impact from spent fuel. (Fuel for weapons in another matter, but also entirely different)

You can hug a dry cask (used to store spent fuel) and not receive any significant radiation. The casks can survive being hit by a train.

-The low energy return on energy invested is because it requires a large amount of energy to mine uranium and then a low of concrete and other materials to build the plants.
-It takes at least 15 years to build a new nuclear power plant so will take to long to implement as a solution to decarbonise n the next 20-30 years.
-It requires uranium which is a finite resource. Estimates are that we only have 70 years of uranium left at current consumption rates.
-It requires large amounts of water. Already climate change is causing issues with droughts meaning there is not enough water available in rivers for cooling or in areas where there are heatwaves the water is too hot to use for cooling.",NEGATIVE,financial_constraints

Additionally, and most importantly, the world doesn't have enough base metal reserves to build out even 20 years worth of solar and wind power (and the reserves we do have will not be begun to be mined for at least another 20 years on a best case scenario), but nuclear breeder reactors can sustain the current energy demands of the world quite literally from now until the estimated death of the sun.

Energy storage is of course critical, but you can't reach 100% renewable with it in any imaginable time scale. Pumped hydro are the only means of storing energy in relevant scale, but they won't cut it either. We have hundreds or maybe thousands of those lakes/generators/pumps running currently, globally.

Currently it’s only ~2% of their energy mix, but they are trying to build up to 10 new reactors each year to add about 15x more power from nuclear by 2035 (21 GW -> 300 GW). Considering they don’t really have to ask permission and the federal government has given that directive, I’d imagine they will likely be successful in building much more nuclear generation, maybe not 15x more but a lot. 

In the rest of the world, it’s too expensive politically and financially, and SMRs don’t seem to be very small, modular, or real at this point. They don’t have any commercial scale and if nuclear is gonna be a climate solution, we needed to be breaking ground at the turn of the century. With how long it takes to build, permit, site, and with high interest rates for the foreseeable future, new nuclear may be basically dead outside of China.

It'd also solve an issue we are currently facing with Ukraine. If under threat, the reactors can be disconnected and moved out of hot-zones. They could then be reconnected at back-up sites and can begin providing power again.   


And you're right on the waste front. Some of the newer reactor designs use current reactor waste products and extract as much energy out of the material as possible. Reprocessing of nuclear fuels could mean we get so much more out of them AND we're left with less volatile waste that also has a far, far shorter half-life (as little as 100 years compared to the 10,000 or so years of current designs).   


Oh and it's almost impossible to have these reactors make fissile material (that goes into nuclear warheads) so they wouldn't make THAT issue any more worse than it already is.   


While I'd still want them fairly far away from major settlements, I'd be happy if my country started using SSNRs to meet baseload requirements with our extensive network of renewables making up the rest.

Given the climate crisis and need for low carbon energy, It’s probably a good idea to try to keep existing nuclear power plants online until we can replace them with hydroelectric, solar, wind, or geothermal energy. But given how rapidly we need to move to a low carbon electrical grid, I don’t see much point in starting new nuclear plant projects now. They would take decades to finish.

Its not like we stopped using wood when we started digging up coal, or coal when we started pumping oil and gas. We use more of each of those fuel sources than ever before; its not instead of its 'as well as'.

Nuclear power should be part of our energy mix for many reasons; vast amounts of energy from a non-fossil fuel source. The pollution it generates while dangerous is small in volume and i think we can manage it, and the trade off against developing the technology seems fair. If we crack fusion as applied engineering then more than fair.

However...

In my opinion it is still an environmentally insensitive technology, and as such should not form the bulk of our energy generation. Rather act as a buffer for truly renewable and green energy sources, and an industry for developing the tech.
Its main draw backs imo being; it does not redistribute energy production and represents a technocratic high tech single point of failure; requires vast up front material and capital investment; like fossil fuels and unlike other 'renewables' it burns a finite resource as an additional energy source to the sun forcing the ghg global warming effect.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example  and  and  and 

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc.

France,Solar,"""The problem
Extracting energy from the environment requires an energy investment, such as to extract and refine oil, or to manufacture a wind turbine. A widespread view is that renewable energy systems require the investment of much more energy per unit of energy delivered than fossil fuels, leading to a low energy return on investment (EROI) — the ratio of energy delivered to energy invested. The implications of this situation would be far-reaching, raising the question of whether it is possible to sustain an industrial society under a renewable energy system. Yet, it is noteworthy that this narrative has been questioned by studies adopting equivalent analysis boundaries for fossil fuels and renewable energy at the final-energy stage (that is, the energy carrier delivered to the end-user, such as electricity or gasoline)1.

Previous studies, however, omitted the fact that renewable energy systems such as wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) yield a high-quality energy carrier: electricity. Electricity end-uses often have higher efficiencies than those of fossil-fuel-based carriers. By including end-use efficiencies, we extend the boundary of analysis to determine the EROI at the useful energy stage, which is the energy available after conversion of a final energy carrier in an end-use device (for example, a car engine).""",NEUTRAL,infrastructure

- The vast majority of new primary energy production will come from solar and wind, but other renewables and nuclear power will also play a smaller role.

- Insulation, reduction of food waste, reduced need for transport, and other draw-downs of demand will offset part of the continued increase in electricity need. (Personal note: All these reductions in demand are incredible cost-savers, and that they're not already being done everywhere is a failure of our political and economic system.)

Fessenheim produced annually 11679 GWh of electricy with 2 medium-large reactors (

For your long message: men are not prone to expressing commitment, even though they act like it.

Maybe his long term relationship ended in such a way that he's extra wary of committing. Or maybe he knows that a relationship means you moving to Europe for him and that's a lot of pressure for something ""recent"".

  
In any case, I think he's making logical sense in his approach. If you want both to keep this relationship going long term, at some point someone will have to move in the other one's country and finding out if you can live together as Parisians is a great step for that.

In summary, the OP's analysis fails to compare nuclear with the coal plants it would supplant.  I too prefer wind and solar, but they can only grow so fast and have problems dealing with base demand.  Nuclear is an excellent complement.  ",NEUTRAL,infrastructure
France,Solar,"I definitely *wouldn't* rule out nuclear as an option for future energy generation.

The best argument I've heard suggests that nuclear capacity should be maintained at its current rate. In other words, new nuclear reactors should only be built to replace old reactors that close down. This should help maintain uranium reserves, although as the supply of uranium becomes less plentiful and harder to extract the cost of using it will go up. It also should help finding suitable sites for new stations, since in many cases they can be built in the same location as the reactor they're due to replace.

Most of the problems with nuclear - safety risks, waste disposal, construction over-runs - are engineering problems that have known solutions. Unfortunately, these solutions don't come cheap. However, putting in place a suitable renewable energy network that can handle baseload demand could be similarly expensive. Nuclear generation will benefit from the rising cost of carbon (just as renewables will) and may be a more attractive option in the next few years.

In the UK, the Scottish parliament has ruled out building any new nuclear reactors. This makes sense, since Scotland has ample opportunity for wind, wave and tidal energy generation. A big majority of the UK's renewable energy targets are likely to come from Scotland. The south of the country is less fortunate, and it also happens to be where energy demand is highest. Siting new nuclear stations close to areas of high demand will mean fewer transmission losses. Unfortunately, that means more additional costs due to the higher land value.

A few caveats. Before any new nuclear reactors are built, a thorough study should be done of all the costs (and emissions) involved over the entire life cycle of the plant, especially with regards to decomissioning old reactors. This will allow a fair and honest comparison to be made between nuclear power and the alternatives. Plans should be in place for suitable disposal of waste - most of the UKs nuclear waste is still in temporary storage waiting permanent storage in a facility that has yet to get off the drawing board, which is a disgrace.

Although I'd put wind, solar, hydro and tidal energy before nuclear given the choice, I've a feeling that the shift in thinking to enable our emissions targets to be met will be too much to rely on renewables alone. Even though you're not looking to make the comparison with coal power, there may not turn out to be much choice.

(Bloomberg) -- France faces “substantial” costs and technical challenges if it wants to replace almost all its aging nuclear plants with renewable energy by 2050, the International Energy Agency and the country’s grid operator said Wednesday.

In a report commissioned by the French government, the IEA and Reseau de Transport d’Electricite highlight the need to scale up new technologies and adapt the legal framework to ensure that a network dominated by variable wind and solar generation remains reliable at all times.

The government is targeting a power mix that’s about 35% wind and solar in 2035, up from about 10% last year. While the grid can cope with that, France will need more backup production and energy storage if that share is going to expand much further, the report showed. The country must also consider potential public opposition to large wind and solar farms and new power lines.

“All the costs associated with a high share of renewables, including the costs of storage, demand-side flexibility” and grid development, “might be substantial in France after 2035,” the IEA and RTE said in the report.

State-controlled Electricite de France SA currently has 56 nuclear power stations in operation, with a production capacity of 61 gigawatts, typically producing almost three-quarters of the country’s output. It plans to shut a dozen plants by 2035, and most of the rest by 2050.

While President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of building new reactors to replace some of those retiring, he has deferred a decision until after 2022’s presidential election. Some opposition parties, such as the Greens, are against new atomic plants, pointing to rising costs at EDF’s current nuclear projects in France and the U.K., as well as environmental risks associated with operating the the generators and storing spent fuel.",NEUTRAL,financial_constraints

***I am returning*** *Senate Bill 137 4 without my signature. This bill requires the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), by July 1, 2025, to revise electric rate tariffs for customers in multi-unit residential and nonresidential buildings and public schools with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on their property to allow for account-level netting.*

*California has provided policy and financial support for the customer solar PV market over the last two decades. Support that created the largest customer solar PV market in the country. Given the market's exponential growth and significant cost declines in solar PV systems, it is appropriate and prudent to realign the subsidies provided to customers who choose to install these systems at the expense of customers without solar PV systems.* 

*This is why the CPUC facilitated a robust, public decision-making process over the last several years to revise the applicable electric rate tariffs that provide these rate subsidies to customers with solar PV systems. The revisions adopted by the CPUC from this process focused on aligning these rate subsidies with the measurable value these systems provide to the electric grid and towards furthering the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. This endeavor stems from the growing need to address the affordability of electric bills for all customers.* 

*While I support the continued growth of the customer solar PV market, this bill would compound the challenge of electric bill affordability by overturning a key component of a recent CPUC decision adopting these alignment changes. Specifically, this bill would increase the amount that most customers would pay for their own electric service to provide a rate subsidy to certain customers, and public schools, that install solar PV systems on their property.* ***For these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.***",NEUTRAL,infrastructure

The Japanese  government has been promoting to use domestic species, Japanese cedar,  for wood usage by providing several forest-related industries with a  large amount of subsidies.

Now as a result, many forests are  harvested due to the increased demand for wood biomass. Many of those  areas have not been replanted. You can see many bare lands in the  Japanese mountains.

France,Solar,"The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday passed a proposal that will reduce compensation provided to households for the surplus electricity their rooftop solar panels contribute to the electric grid.  
  
Utilities and consumer groups have argued the incentive payments have unfairly favored wealthier consumers and harmed poor and low-income households. But solar companies and renewable advocates have said that lowering the compensation would slow solar installations and hinder the state’s goals to address climate change.  
  
The proposal, which California utility regulators unveiled last month, will change a net metering policy by paying solar owners for extra power at a lower rate, which is determined by the cost the utility would need to spend to purchase clean power from an alternative source. The solar industry has said the plan would amount to a 75% cut in average payment rates to customers.  
  
Today’s unanimous vote by the five-member commission was monitored across the country, since California is widely viewed as a leader in the renewable energy buildout. The impact of today’s decision will likely extend beyond the state and have implications for the solar industry nationwide, particularly companies in the residential solar space like Sunrun, SunPower, Sunnova, and Tesla.  
  
More than 1.5 million homes, businesses and other utility customers in California have rooftop solar panels. The utilities commission estimates that these installations can collectively produce 12 gigawatts of electricity.

France,Solar,This again. Who is it on Reddit who uses negative prices as a scare tactic on a weekly basis?,NEGATIVE,technological_shortcomings
France,Solar,"So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

First, reactors can be shut down almost instantaneously. This is for safety. They do keep producing about 8% of their heat though after shut down for about a day. This is removed by, usually, just bleeding steam to the turbine generators, but there are backup methods to this, again, for safety.

A small-ish portion of a nuclear power plant's daily operating cost comes from fuel consumption. A huge portion of the daily operating cost for fossil fuel plants come from fuel consumption. So it's not very cost effective to shut down a nuclear reactor.

As for how long it takes to start up and shut down nuclear plants, it does take awhile if you want to avoid emergency methods. But this is something that was designed in to allow the plants to operate with lower enrichment and large size. If you have a plant designed differently, like with a smaller size, this allows rapid changes in load. Rapid changes in load may become more desired now that renewables are a wide-scale thing. This allows nuclear plants to quickly adapt to changing demand profiles caused by wind and solar variations while still keeping energy green.

Basically, small size nuclear plants are a green solution to make up for the gaps needed to be filled by changing renewable power production.

As for the excess power produced. France just needs to invite companies in that have needs for energy but can take advantage of low grid demand. For example, turning seawater into pure water is energy intensive, but you could only switch those on during peak solar hours. Same thing for producing H2 and O2 gas from H2O. Same thing for producing cryogenic liquids. Same thing for smelting metals (although, I'm not 100% sure about that one).

France,Solar,"Hot take, but let's not oversimplify the issue.  Distributed solar (ie, rooftop) is referred to as ""grid edge"" power because it's produced out on the edge of the utility's distribution network (power lines, etc).  There are a lot of great things about this, such a reduced transmission losses, but there are also downsides.

Solar energy is (obviously) produced in a cyclical fashion, dependent on the availability of sunlight.  But electricity consumption is not based on the availability of sunlight, it's based on users.  When production and consumption don't perfectly align, the utility needs a way to balance supply and demand.  Batteries are one way to do this, but at the scale required by a municipal utility this isn't a realistic solution (yet?).  Instead, they rely on electricity generation that can be scaled to demand, such as a fossil-fuel based peaker plant.  These days, that's probably natural gas.  Wind, hydro and nuclear are not good peaker plants, because they can't be turned on and off quickly.

However, even fossil fuel based electricity generation needs to be ""on"" for long enough to be commercially viable.  When excess solar energy drives electricity rates low or into negative territory, it makes it impossible for a fossil fuel-based power plant to remain online/in business.  Now, you might be saying ""great, that's what we want!""  Except without this option to smooth out unequal electricity supply and demand, we've now created a power distribution system where there is NO power available when there are fluctuations in demand.  That is to say, brownouts and blackouts.

I don't believe this is an insurmountable problem, or one that should discourage the development of new small-scale solar installations.  As it stands, consumption far outstrips demand and it is rare for on-site renewables to produce significantly more power than is used on-site.

When more PV electrons are being sloshed into the system than electricity is being demanded, you **have** to ramp up and down in complicated ways so as to not harm physical assets. The ramping is expensive. 

It wouldn’t matter if it was operated by the government or w/e, you’d still have to ramp, and it would still be expensive, and instead of representing a claim on the economy via retail electricity rates it would be more income paid in taxes or something (or just the same effect on retail rates, either or)

France,Solar,"Unfortunately it’s true. The financials for solar power make less and less sense as you install more. Market electricity prices change as the supply and demand change, and if you’ve got a glut of energy at any particular time then the price goes way down. If it goes down enough you significantly extend out the time to recoup the investment, and in extreme cases you can fail to make your money back.  Beyond a certain level the market won’t drive solar installations as they don’t make any money.

This is also the reason the “cost per kWh” comparisons you see don’t actually tell you the whole story.

Is there is some kind of sensor/meter that can measure solar radiance and then turn on a relay that can control an appliance like a water heater? My growatt SPF 5000 Inverter seem not to have that option, it simply float charges the battery with a small current/wattage and unless you put the load on it you do not know how much energy it receives from the solar array. 

I have an off grid system and i do not wish to use the energy from the battery banks for big appliances like water heater, I rather use the energy from solar array when there is enough of it to run the water heater.  



Here is an example how I think that solution should work;  if my solar array produces over 1.4KW at any given time then solar relay/sensor will turn on the water heater that uses 1.2KW. That way solar panel array produces enough energy to run the water heater without taking some of the power from the  battery array. Consequently,  if current solar array output drops below 1.4KW then solar sensor/relay turns off the heater until solar conditions improve enough so that water heater can run purely of the solar array.

This is without considering the incredibly difficult to calculate ""excess cancer deaths"" due to events like Fukushima and Chernobyl.

Not to mention the even less calculable figure of ""deaths saved"" when polluting energy sources are replaced by non-polluting/lower polluting energy sources. Its impossible to calculate exactly how many lives have been saved by a reduction in global warming.

My point is the figures here could easily be a function of their methodology, so you should rely more on the order of magnitude difference. In other words wind/solar/nuclear/hydro are safe, probably to the same degree, and we should be investing in all of these energy success.

Not to mention, that all these figures are nothing compared to excess deaths the planet is seeing each day right now from Covid. Yes, energy generation is a choice, covid isn't.

>LCOE

LCOE is the cost the generator must sell electricity at to break even. It is a figure that varies from its many inputs, will vary region to region and is aimed at investors and businesses. Hence, it almost always includes subsidies which in this case means lots of subsidies for renewables and very few for nuclear.

On top of this, as it's simply a figure of how much a generators must earn to break even, it does not include external costs (i.e. a major component of end-user costs). In the case of variable renewables this means storage and/or backup. These costs are not immediately visible, but when these subsidies and external costs are included, the cost for a nuclear power grid is actually cheaper than a renewable grid in most cases. This was explored in the peer reviewed MIT report [The Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World]( 

The short version: backup sufficient to meet grid reliability standards is very expensive and even using outrageous western nuclear power costs, nuclear is still cheaper than that.

>Second argument

His argument is nonsense sprinkled in with some reality.

Yes, running nuclear power plants intermittently as variable renewable output goes up and down would would be stupid and expensive... But if you have enough nuclear capacity to back up your wind production, why the fuck would you build renewables? What point would be served when you already have a low CO2 source of power?

France,Solar,"A lot to unwrap here.

First and foremost it must be understood that LCOE not a measurement of utility, it is loved by those that support renewables because it does not take into account the ancillary cost of variable renewable energy (VRE) which include the need for backup, most often in the form of natural gas generation.

LCOE also does not address the issue of the amount of energy any given installation can produce. A low cost per MW hr  is somewhat meaningless if the quantity being produced does not meet needs.

You are right, it would be ludicrous to build nuclear plants to support VRE - however the solution to that is not build VRE at all. What would be the point if nuclear plants could provide a constant and reliable source of electricity?

Cost effective energy storage is nowhere near as close as many make it out to be. Yes the cost of Li technology has dropped to nearly tenfold to US$156/kWh from what it started as, but that fact in and of itself is no guarantee it will fall to the US$20/kWh it needs to be. This is particularly a concern if  pressure starts to build on the raw material inputs. Furthermore as it relates to decarbonizing the transportation sector, the maximum theoretical potential of advanced lithium-ion batteries is still only about 6 percent of crude oil.

But what of other technologies that show up in the press time to time, surely one of them will be better? No. First there is no guarantee any of these will scale.  One can, however, use thermodynamics to calculate the upper limits of what’s possible for electrochemical based storage and when we do this, it becomes clear that these technologies will never compete with combustion of liquid fuels on energy density.

Energy density is also the major difficulty with hydrogen and while processes exist to use it and captured CO2 to make synfuels, this itself is very lossy and cannot be done effectively with VRE only energy inputs.",NEGATIVE,infrastructure

France,Wind,"""The problem
Extracting energy from the environment requires an energy investment, such as to extract and refine oil, or to manufacture a wind turbine. A widespread view is that renewable energy systems require the investment of much more energy per unit of energy delivered than fossil fuels, leading to a low energy return on investment (EROI) — the ratio of energy delivered to energy invested. The implications of this situation would be far-reaching, raising the question of whether it is possible to sustain an industrial society under a renewable energy system. Yet, it is noteworthy that this narrative has been questioned by studies adopting equivalent analysis boundaries for fossil fuels and renewable energy at the final-energy stage (that is, the energy carrier delivered to the end-user, such as electricity or gasoline)1.

Previous studies, however, omitted the fact that renewable energy systems such as wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) yield a high-quality energy carrier: electricity. Electricity end-uses often have higher efficiencies than those of fossil-fuel-based carriers. By including end-use efficiencies, we extend the boundary of analysis to determine the EROI at the useful energy stage, which is the energy available after conversion of a final energy carrier in an end-use device (for example, a car engine).""",NEUTRAL,infrastructure

Or hit up one of many summaries available online, for example [CarbonBrief]( (I have no idea if they're the best, but the name sticks.)

Here's a [Twitter thread]( by someone who claims to be one of the lead authors on the IPCC report. 

For a very basic summary:

- We don't think we can completely stop all fossil fuel use by 2050 _while continuing economic growth_ and allowing increased standards of living in poorer countries - but it can be massively drawn down. Coal must stop and all other fossil fuel use must be abated with carbon capture.

- The vast majority of new primary energy production will come from solar and wind, but other renewables and nuclear power will also play a smaller role.

- Insulation, reduction of food waste, reduced need for transport, and other draw-downs of demand will offset part of the continued increase in electricity need. (Personal note: All these reductions in demand are incredible cost-savers, and that they're not already being done everywhere is a failure of our political and economic system.)

Wind and Solar power are the main culprits behind the Texas grid being less reliable than it should be. 

Pointing the finger at the failures of the Natural Gas pipeline infrastructure is a valid point. The pipelines would have had issues whether or not renewables expanded to the extent they have today and there is no getting around that. 

Still, this ignores the fact that fossil fuel generation has been neglected for the past quarter century due to aggressive green policy agendas that seek to move into a carbon neutral future overnight. 

The massive expansion of renewable generation in West Texas over the past 15 years has come at the expense of more reliable forms of generation and it has been accomplished in an anti competitive fashion, through excessive subsidies and related incentives. 

It’s really a matter of simple economics and it has been playing out for more than a decade. This extreme weather event was the straw that broke the camels back.

Power companies will bankrupt themselves weatherizing their facilities that cost ~$50Mw to run due to fuel prices, because they are forced to run these fossil fuel units unprofitably as they are paid the same auction clearing Mw price as renewable generation, who’s marginal costs are ~$5Mw thanks to excessive subsidies. 


Had reliability of the grid been taken as seriously as the reduction of emissions, through appropriate economic incentives, there would have been more Nuclear Units and Fossil Fuel based generation online, with the ability to increase generation immediately to match the real time demand spike, leading to fewer outages and a more resilient grid overall.

Wonder why this is the standard on reporting about these. From experience, I'd surmise the storage capacity is close to 30MWh, but usually you have to dig for this information.

It's not exactly the same scale as hydro. I think the largest is in australia with 100+MWh of storage. Usually designed more for short-term balancing, afaik.

edit: this seems to suggest 120MWh, with 30MW effect :

>and a 30-megawatt battery; the battery has a duration of four hours.

Which is nice of course, but good to remember scales (and other potential solutions for long-term storage) :

[

>Pumped storage is by far the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, and, as of 2020, the United States Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database reports that PSH accounts for around 95% of all active tracked storage installations worldwide, with a total installed throughput capacity of over 181 GW, of which about 29 GW are in the United States, and a total installed storage capacity of over 1.6 TWh, of which about 250 GWh are in the United States.

France,Wind,"Former president [Donald Trump]( repeatedly ranted about wind power during a fundraising [dinner with oil and gas industry executives]( last week, falsely claiming that the renewable-energy source is unreliable, unattractive and bad for the environment.

“I hate wind,” Trump told the executives over a meal of chopped steak at his Mar-a-Lago Club and resort in Florida, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.

Trump’s comments reveal how he is wooing potential donors with his long-standing hostility to wind farms and pledges to halt this form of renewable energy if he returns to office. His stance poses a potential threat to one of the linchpins of America’s clean energy transition, according to more than a dozen Trump allies, energy experts and offshore wind industry officials.

Even if [President Biden]( were to win reelection, experts say, opponents of offshore wind will remain emboldened by Trump’s stance and well positioned to challenge a new generation of projects in federal waters.

And if Trump were to return to the White House?

“If I were in the offshore wind industry, I would probably be pretty, pretty nervous,” said a former Trump administration energy official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Trump campaign did not respond to specific questions for this story, and it has not elaborated on his energy policies, which he has often summarized as [“drill, baby, drill.”]( In an emailed statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president would “make America energy dominant again.”

“Interested to see the energy output compared to a standard turbine, they conveniently left it out which makes me very skeptical.

Edit: Someone wrote this in response

“A standard full-sized wind turbine produces roughly 1.5-2 Megawatts (1,500,000-2,000,000 W) at optimal wind speeds and optimal wind directions (which depends on the model), and then diminish at subobtimal conditions.

The bladeless turbine however is estimated to output only 100W, or around a staggering 0.0066 - 0.005% the output of a traditional turbine. But the targetted audience is completely different.” “",NEGATIVE,technological_shortcomings

France,Wind,"From someone that lives in windy state, these are very common. But there are tons of things that you must take into consideration. There is a minimum amount of wind required to generate that can be effected by placement, trees, structures and geographical features. The turbine needs an engine break, which essentially disengages the clutch if it spins too fast (travel through the plains states and look at the older massive turbines that have black oil all down their pilars, this is from over spinning and can cause parts to break or prematurely fail). You will need an electrician to wire it to your structure or the battery bank to you structure. Yes you will need a battery bank if you plan on storing energy for windless days. You will most likely need a platform poured unless you pan to attach this to an existing structure, which may interfere with energy production. Depending on how much electricity your household utilizes, this may exceed the cost to benefit ratio. If you over produce, your electric company may or may not pay you for that additional electricity, depends on the state. Not to mention, you want to make certain whatever brand you select has replacement parts, some of the cheaper models do not offer this. Link below is a starting place for home turbines

France,Wind,The foundation will cost you a lot more than that.,NEGATIVE,technological_shortcomings
France,Wind,"I'm doing a school project right now where I'm logging wind speeds on a day to day basis. These turbines are rated for their rated power at ~20mph winds. Where I live, wind speeds keep bouncing between 3 to 9 mph. If I got this turbine, I would make full power ONCE a year, in a storm. For the rest of the year, I would make less than 240 wh a day. Instead, if I bought a $100 100 watt solar panel, I would make roughly 400 wh in a day, on average.
If I bought the wind turbine, I'm effectively paying $400 for a thing that is realistically going to generate only half the power of something that is 1/4 the price.

I'm not saying these home wind turbines are a bad idea, it's just that there is not really as much research going into them. And even if there was, the installation process would be much less flexible than solar. For a wind turbine that generates 100 watts reliably in my area, it would have to have at least a 1000w rating, and that would be A HUGE turbine. On the other hand, 100w solar panels are small, when compared to the equivalent wind turbine.

I can only see wind turbines be practical when they are used commercially. Otherwise, a home turbine would require much more thought than just buying something from online.",NEUTRAL,infrastructure
