Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"While the rest of the world is building new nuclear reactors, and  some putting their older ones back online, Australia is squandering opportunity with only  wind and solar and other low electricity- producing technologies. We are selling our gas, coal and oil, all the while we are starving for power and what power we have is skyrocketing in price. The conversation for nuclear power in Australia must be had."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,It doesn't comply with Albos wealthy mates  agenda.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,They all have their fingers in the Wind and Solar pie being paid by the rich investors! Don’t listen to the people just take the money ? Nuclear is the only way to go and keeping Coal!
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,These guys have no ideas themselves yet are ready to mock others!Get rid of this Albo clown!
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Nuclear needs to be on the table. It’s clean green energy.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Albo will run us into the ground then blame Bowen
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Our PM is some kind of joke.What is the the MSM love affair with him? It's freaking me out and should freak ""everyone"" out. No PM ever has had this kind of ""LOOOOOVE"". It's just so clearly wrong."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Do a check on who donated to Albanese, how many shares he has in renewables and when he bought them. Always follow the money, it never lies."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,So ALBO has now upset his mate Mal in SA too. Is this why he has suddenly got COVID to go into hiding!
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Albo thinks he’s got all the answers FGS. He’s got no idea. Berates Sth Aust Premier suggesting to look into Nuclear Energy for power sources, after he said I’ll look into any suggestions. Nuclear Energy is safe.It’s used for 11% of energy around the world and safely.It’s either Coal or Nuclear Energy for all power sources.All the others just can’t produce enough.It’s so plain to see but Albo knows best FGS."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,It just solidifies what an out of touch touch PM we have he so blind and influenced by Bowen. it is unbelievable between these two depots and their policies will cause the turning of our country into a third World Nation  When will Australians wake up. Too late l think
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Looks like everyone is expected to hold the party line in Labor, even if you have better ideas."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,WHAT? A labour Premier speaking sense. Stay with it P M ie Peter Malinauskas.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Mal has alot more brains than Albo!
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,People voted on gay marriage. Why can't the people vote on the subject. After all it is usually the people's money.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,We know who the joke is.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"The problem with people is when they talk nuclear, everyone starts to think 1950's technology. France has a policy of dealing with their own waste, including nuclear fuel rods and 40% of the fuel used to power their nuclear plants is recycled."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"What a pathetic position to take , if it's safe enough for a massive submarine to have a nuclear generator inside running for 20 years on a handful of nuclear fuel surely we can look into this. It should have happened in the fifties when it was brought up. It's OK for you to say it's your opinion, but what are your real reasons? Nonof what you mentioned are relevant."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,These people are living in FAIRYLAND they are not working for us just there globle elet mates
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Lets be honest Australia needs a better electricity system before the idiots get excited about changing our power supplies . The lets rush in renewable energy isn't gonna work for anybody,  it will kill families n businesses with costs and disruptions .I agree we should look at alternatives but for fark sake think before jumping"
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,albo is the biggest hoke
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Lost count of how many people write me off when I mention nuclear energy and start talking about Chernobyl 
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Time Nuclear energy was discussed! If Australia does not agree with it, why are we exporting Uranium?."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Has Bolt moved to SA yet?
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Just for balance here’s a sample from a report with a quite different view ofSMRs.The whole thing is worth a read: “Too late, too expensive, too risky and too uncertain” is how a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) described NuScale’s proposed small modular reactor (SMR) project."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Albo hasn't done a bad job up till now but he has totally got it wrong over nuclear. Sadly he is so agenda focussed on renewables that options are totally off his radar. Renewables are nowhere near as clean as nuclear, not even close."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"There is still no safe way to dispose of nuclear waste safely. It has a half life of thousand of years.Also nuclear power plants have a lead in time of 10 + years, and are hugely expensive."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Unfortunately for Australians he is fixated for wind and Solar. Tunnel vision.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,He is one of his Labour mates.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Albo you and your Labor cronies are out of date, wake up, nuclear has been in submarines safety for 20 plus years."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Albanese the CC fool !!!   Nuclear is far better than renewables Albanese. And the NEW Coal Power Stations are superb evidently.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Runs scared - yes. And dumb, with IQ 3 Minister Bowen."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,It's what you learn when you know it all that's important. Albo obviously has hubris not Covid.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Nuclear power is EXPENSIVE. How do you propose to deal with the waste? Your just pushing your typical anti everything
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,So is China missile  nukes  can hit any part Aussie   even  nuclear  power  stations
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"It hasn’t taken that long for another Labor prime minister, Albanese, to show he’s not up to the job.Happens every time they get into power."
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Geoff Koloveros 
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Keep up the good work bolt labor’s greatest asset 
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Because Albanese isn’t well enough education on this, that’s why he is talking and scaremongering everyone else, especially to children of a very young age, older children would already know the trues…as most countries in Europe depend on nuclear heating / others…"
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Aussie should have been nuclear in the fifties.
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,"Fool, where is he going to put all these Batteries, I am glad I did not VOTE FOR HIM,"
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Albo doesn't want to offend his Greenie masters
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Follow the money solar panels wind farms useless but are making someone really rich
Nuclear energy industryM9GIzzmWkKh4v1BTFdbPBJFt31z14TKATyD6ZADU,Albanese is living in fantasy land if he thinks we can run the country with wind & solar

"Why nuclear energy won’t work in AustraliaThere is something almost comical about the Liberals and Nationals throwing the forlorn spectre of nuclear power back into national energy debates, right after their loss in the 2022 “climate election”.",One of the reasons for inaction on climate change and limiting the focus on that instead of the whole issue of environmental collapse and habitat destruction is the manipulation by vested interests with nuclear ambitions. It’s been about inaction ramping up extreme weather impacts to create an emergency mindset to justify nuclear or other options that vested interests can control and monopolise. This relates directly to vested interests being terrified of point of use small scale generation of power for households or relatively small communities who can own and control their power supply. 
"Why nuclear energy won’t work in AustraliaThere is something almost comical about the Liberals and Nationals throwing the forlorn spectre of nuclear power back into national energy debates, right after their loss in the 2022 “climate election”.","It would take 30yrs to build up the infrastructure and skills to build and run a reactor.A more sensible, and doable, step is to build an enrichment industry first. That increases the value add to our uranium expert industry..and ..if..we get nuclear subs and/or nuclear power plants in the future, we can fuel them ourselves.Technologically Australia is inferior to Scotland in the 1940s and 1950s. Scotland went from nothing to its first nuke plant in 1964 (I got a guided tour around it as a kid by my uncle who worked there)."
