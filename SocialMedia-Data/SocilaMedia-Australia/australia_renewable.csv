"Refurbishing our coal plants to extend their working life, scrapping the renewable energy target and ramping up gas exploration is the simplest solution to Australia's power demands in the immediate years to come, writes SkyNews.com.au contributor Gideon Rozner.",Now that is common sense and a logical choice..But unfortunately with an ALP government who worships the climate change cult religion there is absolutely NO hope of any common sense or logical thinking.
"Refurbishing our coal plants to extend their working life, scrapping the renewable energy target and ramping up gas exploration is the simplest solution to Australia's power demands in the immediate years to come, writes SkyNews.com.au contributor Gideon Rozner.","We are so far from Renewable reliance, when Wind Turbines have to be ""Switched Off"" when the wind is too strong, and the Solar Energy Storage, is not able to sustain the Load for any significant time frame when the sun goes down.. Lets go Nuclear. It might cost more to build, but the Infrastructure is already in place, and it is Completely Clean and Reliable.!!!"
"Refurbishing our coal plants to extend their working life, scrapping the renewable energy target and ramping up gas exploration is the simplest solution to Australia's power demands in the immediate years to come, writes SkyNews.com.au contributor Gideon Rozner.",Germany who followed the climate change agenda to the letter are in an energy crisis. They are refurbishing  coal fired energy plant's considering continuing with nuclear plants!! renewables are not reliable and do not provide base load power.  Australia needs to take note .and stop implementing this climate change madness!!

It okay for the wealthy they won’t be affected and as for climate change if they think that we can change the weather  they are living in a dream ,as long asChina and India  do nothing the rest of the world are wasting their  time and causing suffering to their people "

As a trial can ALL Green & Teals seats & it's people go first.  Nice to see how it's done."
"Refurbishing our coal plants to extend their working life, scrapping the renewable energy target and ramping up gas exploration is the simplest solution to Australia's power demands in the immediate years to come, writes SkyNews.com.au contributor Gideon Rozner.",Yep.  Watch the energy prices go up now under this government. Renewables are the most expensive form of energy.  Just because it comes from wind and solar doesn’t mean it’s free.  ESpecially When the wind stops and the sun goes  down or it’s cloudy. And It needs  to be stored then supplied. Nuclear will be the best way in the future as the population grows like most countries in the world.  It’s inevitable.

"Refurbishing our coal plants to extend their working life, scrapping the renewable energy target and ramping up gas exploration is the simplest solution to Australia's power demands in the immediate years to come, writes SkyNews.com.au contributor Gideon Rozner.","Newsflash…2030. The Australian Labor Government has just released its new energy policy. It advises all Australians, if they want to keep warm, to rub two sticks together. This will generate heat in the traditional (and culturally correct) aboriginal way, and hopefully a small flame will be the result of this rigorous activity. However, a press release from the Greens will announce they will oppose this directive, as the use of natural wood and the resulting CO2 emissions directly contradicts its environmental policies. Sky News has replied with Andrew Bolt claiming the removal of every tree in Australia several years ago to build billions of hectares of solar panels means no one has two sticks to rub together. This highlights, Bolt stated, the ineffectiveness of the Labor Government, while the opposition suggests we start importing sticks from China to help the growing number of ‘silent Australians’ warm themselves over the coming winter."

Why else would have they put renewables as the priority;  doesn’t seem to matter that other parts of the world are having energy security problems (some not caused by renewables).  Affordability of energy would be next;  Albo you’ve said you want thing built here.  Ain’t going to happen whilst we have availability of energy and price becoming big issues.  Thick as ten brick.
