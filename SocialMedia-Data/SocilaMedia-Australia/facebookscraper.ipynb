      "Now that is common sense and a logical choice..But unfortunately with an ALP government who worships the climate change cult religion there is absolutely NO hope of any common sense or logical thinking.\n",
      "We are so far from Renewable reliance, when Wind Turbines have to be \"Switched Off\" when the wind is too strong, and the Solar Energy Storage, is not able to sustain the Load for any significant time frame when the sun goes down.. Lets go Nuclear. It might cost more to build, but the Infrastructure is already in place, and it is Completely Clean and Reliable.!!!\n",
      "Germany who followed the climate change agenda to the letter are in an energy crisis. They are refurbishing  coal fired energy plant's considering continuing with nuclear plants!! renewables are not reliable and do not provide base load power.  Australia needs to take note .and stop implementing this climate change madness!!\n",
      "You can not shut one source of power until the other one is up and running and affordable prices for everyday families. It okay for the wealthy they won’t be affected and as for climate change if they think that we can change the weather  they are living in a dream ,as long asChina and India  do nothing the rest of the world are wasting their  time and causing suffering to their people \n",
      "Maybe when there are continuous black outs in Victoria and people are faced with continuing cost of power some of these lefty politicians will see the error of their ways.\n",
      "No hope with the climate change cult worshippers we have now. When the country has no power and is destitute, they’ll just blame the previous government/ China/ Russia. We need to build new coal fired power stations, stop selling all our coal cheap overseas then invest in nuclear power.\n",
      "The quickest simplest solution yes, but a long term reliable solution is nuclear.\n",
      "100% correct. But with crazies in power, this will never happen. In fact, the ideological fools have now started on coal mines by banning a Clive Palmer project.\n",
      "No, I think nuclear energy/ fusion is the most clean, efficient way forward. Nuclear energy needs to be part of the solution with Gas and clean coal. Solar and wind are not self sustainable, and unreliable for mass energy production, without impacting the environment.\n",
      "So very true and easy.. Albo is brain washed by climate change so I can not see him doing the one thing that will help us all to have more reliable cheaper power ..\n",
      "We are in for the biggest 'i told you so'! the world has ever seen. Get back in three years snowflakes.\n",
      "And can we expect a common sense and logical response from the Federal Government? And the answer to that is NO. Maybe the electorate will change their tune with increasing cost of utility bills and black outs occurring because the grid cannot cope with demand.\n",
      "Listening to the Greens, Teals...our community is best served & will be globally the most virtuous by 100% importing wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles,  de-stocking our farms & reforesting them.  As a trial can ALL Green & Teals seats & it's people go first.  Nice to see how it's done.\n",
      "Yep.  Watch the energy prices go up now under this government. Renewables are the most expensive form of energy.  Just because it comes from wind and solar doesn’t mean it’s free.  ESpecially When the wind stops and the sun goes  down or it’s cloudy. And It needs  to be stored then supplied. Nuclear will be the best way in the future as the population grows like most countries in the world.  It’s inevitable.\n",
      "The small nuclear modular power plants are the future but we will need coal and gas until they are built. Wind and solar have proven themselves expensive and unreliable\n",
      "It’s the only way to save the economy, and keep pace with expanding economies like China and India who are exempt from environmental protocols.\n",
      "Nooooo. Let’s continue to sell our highest quality coal to China\n",
      "Australia has been without strong leadership for many years\n",
      "Absolutely. Paying for renewables which will die before they are paid for is economic suicide. But it’s ok, we the consumer has been conned into thinking we are saving the planet and not paying bills. Forget about the initial investment.\n",
      "if we are banning the use of gas and coal in Australia then we should ban its export.\n",
      "Yes, and we must also begin work on nuclear power plants, as part of an energy mix.\n",
      "Newsflash…2030. The Australian Labor Government has just released its new energy policy. It advises all Australians, if they want to keep warm, to rub two sticks together. This will generate heat in the traditional (and culturally correct) aboriginal way, and hopefully a small flame will be the result of this rigorous activity. However, a press release from the Greens will announce they will oppose this directive, as the use of natural wood and the resulting CO2 emissions directly contradicts its environmental policies. Sky News has replied with Andrew Bolt claiming the removal of every tree in Australia several years ago to build billions of hectares of solar panels means no one has two sticks to rub together. This highlights, Bolt stated, the ineffectiveness of the Labor Government, while the opposition suggests we start importing sticks from China to help the growing number of ‘silent Australians’ warm themselves over the coming winter.\n",
      "Completely agree 100% and this is going to be the downfall of the labour government with these green net zero policies that will cripple this country and then they will soon realise what they've done was wrong and the people will soon realise how stupid they have been to vote for this government\n",
      "Yet, we are sitting on one of the worlds largest uranium deposits & could easily be experiencing some of the most reliable, clean, cheap, power for ALL our needs!!!DUHHH!!! Why???\n",
      "Oh dear. They really have it bad.  Too bad that the majority of Australians are moving on.  At this rate sky news will become irrelevant before fossil fuels become redundant. Wont be too much longer now.\n",
      "Gideon, blind Freddy could could see this too. Seemingly none of the intelligent elite gave consideration to a sensible transition phase(s), so star struck are they by renewables and target dates they forgot the rest. Bowen will handle his current portfolio in the same manner he handled the migration portfolio - both will be a disaster.\n",
      "Agree with the author. We also have to start with building Nuclear  Power stations NOW . Use what we need sell the excess coal and gas\n",
      "Governments do NOT understand the meaning of COMMON SENCE along with so many in the world today\n",
      "The goal is to crash economies using green energy as an excuse.   To many fell for it.\n",
      "Anyone that voted for independents don't complain you have got what you asked for.\n",
      "yep instead of sending it all to China\n",
      "The first priority should have been energy security but apparently we don’t have a problem with that according to Albo and Bowen.  Why else would have they put renewables as the priority;  doesn’t seem to matter that other parts of the world are having energy security problems (some not caused by renewables).  Affordability of energy would be next;  Albo you’ve said you want thing built here.  Ain’t going to happen whilst we have availability of energy and price becoming big issues.  Thick as ten brick.\n",
      "We are being fed misinformation.  Coal is a resource we need at present because our energy system is in chaos.  While there are Wars and potential political conflicts we need to increase our energy output so as manufacturing can produce what we used to import.\n",
      "Green lunatics will bankrupt the country.\n",
      "We wouldn't have a crisis if it wasn't for the renewable mania!\n",
      "The article is largely correct, but omits the very important nuclear energy option.\n",
      "I am waiting for the whole green renewable idea to crash and burn.They may all wake up to the lies,  the green have been feeding us to line their own pockets We are now at a point that the only thing that will wake people up is power outages,  food shortages,  and mortgages that are out of control.\n",
      "This is the way to go . People need to live and it is about \" balance\". This carbon emmissions has become a joke for countries that need to basically live & survive!.                   This is cutting off their nose to spite their face!\". Mean while  the major countries that are the biggest polluters  carry  on living their way of life , with barely a change of their lifestyle?. These countries  should be doing more of their share  for \" Mother earth\".  Do we see them cutting  back ?.\" NO \" . Countries governments  that are pushing this agenda are \" ideoligists and theorists\", they are \" virtual signaling\" & do not live in the real world. They live in their rich bubble , they look after themselves because they can afford it. Realistically , the average lowly subjects will  struggle continuously all their lives unless there  is a \"balance \" across the board , the world. Countries need to take care of their \"OWN \". UN needs to  stop dictating directions &  distributing the problems throughout the world especially after this widely spread \" Pandemic environment\"  .   This , all in the name of 'climate change\"?. There needs  to be a better way for humans to live.\n",
      "Build new coal fired power stations.\n",
      "Governments around the world have thrown money at this for decades pointlessly. You don’t have to be terribly smart to be a Polly.\n",
      "Use our resources stop the globalist adgendas build modular nuclear power plants make Australia great again\n",
      "So right Gideon  but unfortunately we are going down the unstable wind and solar path\n",
      "Our coal fleet is aging, built in the 70's and the 80's, we need to build HELE plants, more efficient and less emissions than older design plants, wind and solar are intermittent power generation.\n",
      "And get started on nuclear power.\n",
      "A commitment by government should always be supporting whatever is plentiful in resources and or has continuous abilty to generate base load power for the nation, now and into the future. And that is having multiple forms of energy generation from coal, gas, waste to energy, tidal, hydropower and localised power generation with wind and solar as the last two cannot generate base load power for this nation.\n",
      "When you have our politicians with their scare mongers flat out day in day out preaching. Saying that if we don’t change to renewables x amount of people will die from heat stress illnesses. Yes they will if they can’t or too scared to turn on their air conditioners. We need to wake up and yes look into advanced technology into coal power station’s. Its like our flooding nothing gets done, trust me renewables are not going to stop the flooding. New technology in getting rid of flood water will, but no our politicians have money invested in renewables.\n",
      "One country had woke up now let’s get the rest on board Because climate change is a load of BS and John Kerry and al gore are at the helm filling their pockets\n",
      "The only way 100% just wish our Govt would get behind it. No reason why Australia should have cheap power with our huge resources coal and gas. We have been sold out.\n",
      "Another one of Rupert's hand picked Mouthpieces Slobbering the Fossil fuel Mantra.\n",
      "Too sensible Gideon! It’s based on truth rather than the “climate change hoax” pushed by the ignorant ideologists…\n",
      "Here in WA, they are building a huge battery that will take excess solar power from house solar panels, and it will only power 160,000 homes for 2 hours!!! Methinks they are going to need acres of batteries!!\n",
      "Virtue signaling will not keep the lights on , stop floods, drought or bush fires.\n",
      "When you only get 32% of the vote then they have to bow down to these climate zealots to survive and get stupid bills through While most Australians agree with renewables as a power source just not at the cost of higher bills and less reliability We need back up power to keep this country viable and coal powered and gas  powered resources are needed\n",
      "Clearly The opinion of Gideon Rozner would know way more about energy sources and power supply than these “so called” experts with decades of education and training in that field.(People actually believe this rubbish?)\n",
      "Can all the greens go live off the land out bush somewhere while the rest of the nation fixes the energy problems\n",
      "If the coal power stations were rebuilt with today's technology,  they are more efficient and have much less emissions. There needs to be a sensible balance between coal, gas, renewable and Hopefully one day nuclear\n",
      "Anyone with half a brain would know this ..which leaves the current ALP Socialist Goverment out completely..not a brain between them all ..only thing is everyone else will suffer the consequences from their Unsustainable Renewable’s push ….\n",
      "Instead of inventing new uses for electricity we need to invent effective, environmentally friendly storage for produced electricity .  This should have been a priority since it's discovery.The continuing issue is that electricity needs to be produced as the demand requires.\n",
      "Given that multiple CO2 sensing satellite systems strongly suggest that the Australian continent is already net zero, we might as well extend the life of coal fired power stations, although what Australia really needs is to go nuclear.\n",
      "We have to obey the inner city wealthy\n",
      "Well that's probably commonsense to some degree, which is why we are going in the opposite direction, ask Bowen \n",
      "Of course we should be maintaining our coal power stations, and producing more gas for our domestic use while investigating nuclear power, it just makes sense, but then the current Labor, Greens and much of the LNP are lacking in this area, still, the penny will soon drop as it has in Europe, hopefully it wont be too late.\n",
      "Would love that twit Bandt to explain how all the thousands of batteries, massive fans and panels will be made without using all the materials, minerals, resources and traditional power he hates so much. To all that voted for the greens and Teals, thx fa nothing except more debt and hardship.\n",
      "get rid of the wind turbine eyesores and solar panels. They are far from green energy. Nothing but a big fat con by the Globalists !!\n",
      "Gideon is showing very good un-common sense.  Shame our politicians aren’t.\n",
      "I know let’s ignore completely the acidification of our oceans the gigatonnes of carbon pumping into our biosphere each year because it’s cheaper the old way\n",
      "See the example in South Australia under the Weatheril Labor regimes. Highest power prices on the planet.  That's  Albonochio  has in store for the rest of us unfer federal Labor\n",
      "That definitely makes good sense but worst luck we have politicians with no sense they like to blow up old coal fired power stations once they are retired. These actions leave us in a position of electricity starvation where we all need power but their won’t be enough to go around, time to invest in a portable generator because you are going to need it to keep your refrigerator and freezer working. Our kids will have to learn that without electricity their laptops, phones and wifi don’t work.\n",
      "we as Australians can see the only way to go is this ut the government is still dead set on leading us down the garden path to ruination of our country\n",
      "Yes that is true , but we need to go nuclear to sustain our need for future energy demands \n",
      "For the moment while we set up for nuclear power! It has to be part of the plan. Forget about what Air us Albo says. He’s just following plans of the NWO, WEF Great Reset\n",
      "Absolutely correct We are far from being renewable reliance..\n",
      "Why do these clowns oppose cheap power?  Just because it doesn’t serve the foreign owned mining companies?\n",
      "That will never happen, as Albo, Bonehead and Bandit are pushing the 43% emissions target to be achieved in 8 years, once that is passed it then only be sun and wind. The way this bill is being fast tracked that will stop any other sensible ideas being mentioned.\n",
      "Gideone a blind man can see this, why not Labour.\n",
      "You need to keep the coal plants until the renewable options can 100% keep our supplies flowing and people don't have to go cold or hot. Too the people who are dead against coal power stations would you want your families to die from not having power to keep them alive or safe?????????\n",
      "Can anyone explain to me how it's okay for our governments to make so much money from coal exports thus enabling other countries to use coal and yet with all the very talented clever Australians we can't build coal energy facilities that are as clean as possible and would give us the answer to our energy prices and also solve our present shortage. Where has common sense gone?\n",
      "A challenge to the Renewable Politians: open your homes to us and let's see - how much \"dirty\" energy you are currently using.\n",
      "New coal power stations with air filters are approx 99 % emission free and very efficient.\n",
      "And longer term, a serious push towards nuclear….we’re one of the worlds largest producers of uranium and like everything else good that we produce, it’s all exported to serve foreign countries instead of our own\n",
      "The place has gone insane.  Could we please have a Summit on Climate Change where everyone can have their say. We keep getting told about \"The Science\" and gloom and doom by 2030. No one has every explained this \"Science\" to the vast majority of Australians. This is the same \"Science\" that has been telling us for decades about the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. Yesterday we found out just what a lie that was.  The Reef is in very good health. The Greens, Labor, Teal Independents, Independent Liberals and Littleproud and his Nationalised Greens, overwhelmingly run the show. What hope does Peter Dutton have.  We are doomed.\n",
      "Germany has a power crisis so have fired up the coal power plants. We’re so smart in Australia we blew ours to pieces.\n",
      "Problem is with more gas exploration…. Usually it won’t be allocated to domestic use… it just gets exported because it can be sold at three times the price\n",
      "As long as the coal and gas companies pay for the upgrades\n",
      "A lot of the old power plants are Toshiba and they’ve stop making them including parts but go on tell us how to refurbish them\n",
      "12 wind turbines built in Hughenden Qld still not turning. 5-6 years later. Makes no sense\n",
      "We all know the cure for energy crisis but Albo hasnt a clue and dosent want to know his eyes are fixed on being the mesiah but he is the false one.\n",
      "Now so many people are waking  up reading books & listing to what other people have to say So many people , using their common sense about all this Climate Change talk. Our eyes are wide open. We are educated enough to know in reality it is all rubbish & so much of our money is being spent on this fantasy!\n",
      "We all know this but our useless politicians, and what are they going to do when we start having black outs. I know it's the war in Ukraine that will be the reason!! Most other countries are dropping this stupid idea but Australia is full steam ahead. ￼\n",
      "Absolutely, but not with this Labor Government, and who will pay… every Australian will!\n",
      "Yes totally agree but these clowns in the ivory tower ans Albo have no clue\n",
      "And we have the land, poles and wires, uranium, cooling water, and waste dump in Port Augusta.\n",
      "How many years until renewable energy sources are reliable to support everything 24hrs a day? What is our power source until then?\n",
      "Labor and Greens have said they will close down all Fossil Fuels and not allow any new Gas or coal plants ? If Australians want Cheap reliable Electricity they have made a really bad mistake electing Labor and Greens? \n",
      "Clearly this is what we have to do in the short to intermediate term, but just as clearly, we are going to have to go through the pain of Net Zero madness and all its consequences...It's going to be disastrous for many families and small businesses who are going to be ruined by this insanity.And... Labor doesn't care...It's all about ideology, and to them, that's all that does matter.\n",
      "South Australia and Tasmania do not have coal.....and they still have electricity. They had electricity yesterday, last week, and last year.So yes that means that Australia can still have electricity without coal.I find it it really naive that people say if we had more gas fields then more gas would be held back for domestic consumption. It doesn't matter whether we 5 or 15 gas fields if they all want to export all their product overseas.Mandating gas for domestic consumption doesn't require more gas fields, it requires government determination. However a lot of people consider this an over reaction and would prefer a \"market solution\"The quickest solution to more power resources is more renewables.....quickest and cheapest builds.New solar and wind farms take about 2-3 years from planning to exporting power. New gas fields would take 5-7 years from planning to exporting.Nuclear power would take 11 years to how long are you prepared to wait.....from planning to exporting power.NSW and Qld are laggards building renewables...... fortunately both are about to put the foot on the pedal. Qld is building 5 large wind farms right now and NSW is about building plans for it's renewable energy zones.Repairing old coal fired power stations will only get you so far..... Liddell has broken down again this week. You really want to replace coal fired power stations as they are coming to the end of their lives (as in whilst they are still working) not when they are basically dead men walking....hello Liddell!!\n",
      "I have a suggestion for Labour and the Greens, but not only would I get banned from Facebook, I would probably get arrested.\n",
      "Saw on the news last night that the WA government are planning put hundreds of wind turbines in the ocean off our beautiful coastline. Breaks my heart.\n",
      "They have ‘clean’ coal power stations in Japan. Why not here\n",
      "Australia needs to rejuvenate the existing Coal fired electric generating Stations. We have to work slow at switching to other types of electric power generation.  I have rooftop solar panels systems and they work well BUT the existing batteries are not economical to fit yet.  We need to have better efficiency from the batteries.\n",
      "I agree with Gideon. Why would this government try to ruin so many.lives financially and work wise\n",
      "Nuclear is the answer\n",
      "The only answer is we buy off OUR RESOURCES BACK   NATIONALISE everything  like is doing Mexico\n",

      "What's wrong with renewable energy ? As the word means they can be extended. Can coal and gas be renewed?\n",
      "Exactly …there is no urgency to force transition …just Govt & corporates interference for Profit$ & control!\n",
      "And while this is being done, free up Nuclear and start planning for small modular reactors to replace coal & gas.\n",

      "Comments:\n",
      "South Australia reportedly holds huge newly discovered oil reserves potentially worth trillions  yet  Labor ideologues like Weatherill - who presides over the worlds most expensive electricity prices crippling business and hurting households - now wants to ramp up the pain even more..What more proof do people require that Labor is now the party of  Green Left elitism  - not the traditional working class\n",
      "It's called leadership. We're actually seeing it in South Australia. Well you know.. someone has to lead by example. We'll make it happen as well. It's the future you build..the future you make..which matters. Not the future you just think will 'sort itself out' Well done Jay.\n",
      "Surely the voters in SA wont vote for this man again - what a disaster he is and he has turned SA into a basket case.\n",
      "I think Jay Wetherill is a fool. South Australia already has the highest energy prices in Australia and probably the developed world. And yet he continues to lead when it comes to formulating energy policy on idealogical grounds. Does he actually want South Australia to remain an economic basket case?\n",
      "If they vote this loon in again they deserve everything they get . What a disgraceful wasteful & squandered period in office . A dangerous lunatic who makes you wonder what was in it for him to destroy those power plants . Sabotage just to be sure no one can ever use them again. When energy companies make 400 million for a blackout lasting a few days it’s all looks very deliberate to make people suffer for profits .\n",
      "Ring fence SA, no more taxpayers cash from the Feds and shut down the interconnects, let it drown in its own stupidity!\n",
      "Good luck SA. Hope you like the dark, the cold in winter and the heat in summer. I would imagine a BBQ with a full bottle of gas or charcoal on hand at all times would be a must for every household. That will be the industry to be in in SA, and probably the only industry that will be left.\n",
      "Good,awesome investment opportunity. But I'm sure there'll be plenty of dinosaurs who refuse to see that.\n",
      "As a person who runs an off grid household of 5...it can be done and South Australia should be commended. Just remembered that a few short months ago the Feds said they were taking the public to the abyss...bashing this kind of investment is vandalism\n",
      "We will be even more f#@ked thanks to this moronic incompetent peanut and his cronies. Welcome to SA the bankrupt,basket case and black out state.\n",
      "This is what being a green Left ideologue central planning command segment economy mastermind eventually and inevitably leads to - complete disconnect from reality. These self interested ideologues in South Australia are the nation's greatest economic terrorist's. Surely they will not vote them back in, despite that State being virtually held hostage to the unicorn fairy dust ideology after these economic terrorist's just spent the last four years destroying every coal fired power station in the State, leaving any incoming government with nothing to work with but unicorn fairy dust, natural gas, a tax payer purchased crony corporate battery, and a host of emergency hired from the US diesel generators being used 24/7 as a result of their own idiocy.\n",
      "Must have a brain tumour as no one can be that stupid , but if everyone leaves he won't need power .\n",
      "How's the 50% target working out for you Weatherill?  What the hell, might as well double down and shoot for 75%. Maybe he should ring the gamblers hotline and get help...\n",
      "i presume this will include delinking from the coal fired power backstop from victoria and turning off the filthy diesel generators.....then maybe he can be taken seriously......another lefty moron\n",
      "He and his union mates can afford it. Meantime 12,000 a year lose connections, low income earners and pensioners scrimp and turn everything off to put food on the table. Businesses close and struggle, jobs and industry suffer. Rather than one source of low cost energy we have multiple supiers all with different technologies and business plans duplicating and creating inefficiency. Multiple suppliers is what will cost as their investors all push to put up price and profits. A true mess that will cost those that can least afford if.\n",
      "What a wonderful & inspiring leader. Someone with integrity who actually cares for the health of the planet we leave to our kids & understands that the more renewable energy we have the cheaper our energy costs will be \n",
      "Idiot!Victoria should refuse to back up their system. Let them go survive or fail on their own. Same with GST revenues, distribute it according to state earnings. Let Tas n SA stand on their own two feet.\n",
      "I recently visited Iceland, where they boast of having 99.99% renewable energy.  Mind you, they also have volcanos and lots of water to provide the renewable energy, neither of which are overly abundant in SA.\n",
      "Why am I paying for wires and poles on my power bill? It’s not to prop up mad leftie governments. Shut down the interconector and make SA stand on its own two feet. Let’s see how they get on !!!!The ACT stated not long ago that they were going 100% renewables! Great, but do not depend on NSW coal when the wind does not blow and the sun hides behind clouds. That’s simply hypocritical. But then, that’s Labour and the Greens for you.\n",
      "For what, more power outages and a higher cost of living? Even the Chief Scientist Alan Finkel said that if Australia managed to cut 100% of the country's carbon dioxide output, it would virtually have no effect on \"climate change\".\n",
      "More a Chardonnay labour vote catcher, than battlers? Solar and wind are very old, and not so green supply chain technologies, we something new?\n",
      "Nothing wrong with someone actually \"leading\". Labor will be returned. The SA Liberals are dead in the water with Marshall as their leader.\n",
      "Am I reading right or do people still believe in coal gas and oil. The change to renewables is happening so quick. People who don’t believe should just read something. Kookoo\n",
      "Of course that moron will be voted in. Too many morons in SA vote for the easy union and welfare ride. Disgusting creatures.\n",
      "Some say the definition of insanity is to do something the same way hoping to get a different result. That's SAs Jay to a t.\n",
      "And then there's the real world.   Not some greenie tossers dream of utopia that cannot work.  You are part of the problem\n",
      "ROTFLMAO!!!!!  Candles sales and sales of animal skins clothes will skyrocket as SA heads towards the. Middle Ages!\n",
      "Surely it's time for the conservatives to recognise that there day is done - we need more visionaries like Jay.\n",
      "Does he mean that he will only buy power from the other states through AEMO if the generation of that electricity meets that same criteria? Does he also include the recharging of the world's largest battery bank???????\n",
      "What is S.A.'s current renewable %? Is it 15%, and they already have massive problems? Let's not forget the 12 or so Diesel power generators that have been shipped in. How clean and feasible is it to burn Deisel?\n",
      "He must be off his rocker - he is gambling the state's future on unproven technology - this is crazy !\n",
      "Yep... this will end with 75% unemployment...\n",
      "If at first you don't (quite) succeed in stuffing the state's power system, try, try again.\n",
      "Shouldn't that headline read: Jay Weatherill pledges to destroy any hope of South Australia being self reliant & energy efficient?\n",
      "Hahahaha South Australia the rust belt\n",
      "The lunatics are running the asylums . All Australians will be paying in the long term .\n",
      "So labor only wants 25% reliable energy. Well done Muppet's.\n",
      "Hi diddle diddle the cow jumped over the moon\n",
      "SA is the welfare state. Highest unemployment and highest power prices\n",
      "Brenton. Looks like the power will be going out more in SA!\n",
      "No problem, just make sure they disconnect the power supply from the Eastern states.\n",
      "and that's the end of SA labour........ at last\n",
      "Turn off all power stations often enough and the target is easy!\n",
      "At least someone is actually doing something to address both climate change & sustainable energy!\n",
      "SA will see a spike in the sale of candles\n",
      "Pleased someone has a brain.\n",
      "Is that possible in one term, simply by providing $20 MN over 4 years?  I wouldn't have thought so.\n",
      "Still South Australians seem to have faith in him.\n",
      "How are the diesel generators going Weatherill?\n",
      "As long as he can deliver cheap electricity for all, but will it?\n",
      "Why mot make it 100% make a real idiot of himself.\n",
      "I hope South Australians like candles, they're gonna need em \n",
      "How long at what cost some people just don't know or want to know\n",
      "Just keep those diesels cranking in the back where no one can see\n",
      "HE   HAS  NO  IDEA  only    how  to  run  S>A   into  the  ground\n",
      "The candle industry is currently quite excited by this prospect.\n",
      "Maybe 75% of the state will be provided with stationary electricity generating bicycles. These guys are worth more money !!\n",
      "The current GST funding arrangements cocoon the State from this man’s folly.\n",
      "Jay, Rann, Copenhagen. We're the canary.\n",
      "Yep alot of people think they have a vision the problem is alot of people are going to suffer for their visions\n",
      "Who will pay  for his greenie ambitions\n",
      "How bout lifting the energy levels to 75%.\n",

      "This has been seems mentally unstable\n",
      "Best SA not be permitted to use the Eastern states for providing base load.\n",
      "At least the last one out of SA won't have to turn out the lights.  They'll do it themselves.\n",
      "Aren't they paying Elon Musk hundreds of millions to give away free solar systems?\n",

      "I thought he was a honest man all he is journalist for Scott Morrison not fair Andrew Bolt tries to give both sides But Paul doesn’t this even trying to suggest figures are ok etc \n",
      "Journalists with such a poor understanding of mathematics, now that is a real worry.   Labor's policy at the last election was a 50% target - that is half of all electricity generated by renewables.   The Greens might want a 100% target.   But 700%?\n",
      "Let them go ahead and try........when they do I cant wait to hear the SILENCE on Twitter and fb, bc they won’t be able to recharge their devices!\n",

      "This is the clown who'll rule Albo and the Labor party. \n",
      "Just cover more farmlands with those solar panels and clear away the trees to put up wind farms? We will have a Sunday drive to go and look at the living metal things! Might make the target though. Great for climate change. \n",
      "What does 700% mean, the wankers want to produce seven times our requirements. Do they want to export electricity, I don’t think we can have transmission lines to New Zealand, PNG couldn’t pay, between us and East Timor or Indonesia there is the continental shelf. More ridiculous ideas from a party of dope smokers.\n",
      "watch a doco called \"Planet of the Humans\" it's mind blowing.\n",
      "Just an excuse to raise taxes as if we don’t already pay enough \n",

      "I think Brandt, the angry ant has confirmed he really has lost it.\n",
      "The Democrats were also upfront with their dangerous policies which they are now implementing - Australia obviously wants to head the same way. Our PM seems weak in front of all this.\n",

      "Yeah man... lets set up wind farms, solar farms and start mining uranium on sacred indigenous lands across the country... wait, what? Hold up... go back a step man. \n",
      "The biggest threat to Australia is the Chinese taking us over.  They have the military might to just walk in and take our country over.  That’s all thanks to us weakening our economy by letting the UN and greenies dictate our policies on climate change, population growth and the trashing of our manufacturing industries.  Australia needs to ditch all the UN and climate alarmist BS and start manufacturing stuff including cars and our own defence equipment.\n",
      "So when did the Greens go into coalition with Labor?\n",
      "How many bongs have you had mate ?\n",

Apparently the fans have been locked down and will stay this way until being bulldozed into the ground. It will never put one kilowatt back into the grid.

Then you have the massive battery usage for electric cars on top of all of this. African countries are now becoming dumping grounds for vast amounts of disused solar panels laden with lead and other heavy metals.

This includes the inspection certification phase and all the way until the paperwork has been lodged with Powercor and the job has been fully connected to the grid. Our panels come with a 25-year power warranty and our inverters have a standard 10 or 12 year manufacturers warranty. We only use companies that we have built a strong working relationship with and that have a proven track record of supplying quality solar energy products in Australia. This will ensure our customers are buying a quality product with an Australian based warranty with an Australian based company headquarters. At Geelong Solar Energy we believe that personal accountability creates quality customer service, and building strong relationships with our customers is the only way we grow.\n"

      "The materials used in solar panels include silicon, copper, tin, aluminum and glass which are 85% to 95% reclaimed and recycled.\n",
      "We faced a similar issue in the early 80’s with the increasing world wide popularity of motor vehicles and the treatment and disposal of lead acid batteries.\n",
      "How about addressing the 50,000 unrehabilitated mines across Australia that the Mining Industry have just been allowed to walk away from, destroying our agricultural land!\n",
      "There is no technical barrier to fully recycling all components of solar cells and batteries. The same with virtually any manufacturered product. It's just a matter of will, and enforceable legislative actions to make it happen. There are costs, but these are offset by the savings in less need for new mining as materials are recycled as well as the obvious health and aesthetic reasons of eliminating waste.\n",
      "So panels are recyclable, but let’s just say they weren’t, for arguments sake. the average Aussie person creates 1.5 tonnes of landfill per year (source- Greenpeace) and solar panels have a 15 year lifespan (approx). A family of 4 would create 90 tonnes of landfill in 15 years, so chucking 300kg of panels into the bin after 15 years is insignificant. Not that you need to, they’re recyclable. Nice work giving the solar naysayers a nice misinformed one line retort to their anti solar reasoning \n",
      "Congratulations to Griffith University for highlighting a question I've been asking for a few years now - what happens to all the solar panels and batteries at their end-of-life? It's time to start looking at other forms of energy generation - in earnest - it is unrealistic to continue using solar panels that gouge the earth of rare minerals that end up sitting on peoples' rooftops.  We have to find a sustainable solution.In the meantime, the waste generated from the current solar cells must be managed and recycled efficiently and affordably.  We need guiding legislation and bi-partisan government commitment.\n",
      "No hurry. The world's been using nuclear for fifty years and we've no proper way to get rid of its waste. At least with solar the materials are recyclable.\n",
      "Always thought solar energy could be implemented using the same model as mobile phones - monthly contract including maintenance and up grades. This way waste could be best on sold to recycling.\n",
      "Nuclear concerns me as the waste is so toxic and we have  to find a suitable facility to store it.  Fukidhima was a modern, 100% safe power station.  There is no point saying it was in the wrong place, as the disaster  has already occurred.   Chernobyl  was a safe reactor, but it failed.  Five mile island? In the US, another safe one.  We also have to ask how much uranium  is left.\n",
      "Yes, we do need to get a lot better at recycling in general. The market has failed us, so it's up to government. Do we have a government that's up to the challenges?\n",
      "Gee, but fossil fuel industry, plastics, coal..nothing to think about there?\n",
      "You have to look at this issue in perspective to dicommision a coal-fired power station is a big environmental problem. Solar panels and baterys are 90 % recyclable. Not even talking about decommissioning a nuclear plant cost billions.\n",
      "I hope the Product StewardshipAct looks at plastic production.  No new plastic should be produced at all!\n",
      "Not to mention the import trade deficit.\n",
      "The whole waste problem is driven by producers externalising end of life waste costs.There should be no new product bought to market without effective recovery and reuse/sustainable processing of the end of life product being built into the business model.#PollutionIsaBusinessDecision\n",
      "There’s an opportunity for an innovative Australian company!\n",
      "There is a guy on fakebook marketplace who picks up old panels for free! He recycles them \n",
      "Couldn't the unrecyclable parts just be crushed up and mixed with old tyres melted down (no naked flames) and made into a small rubber based pellet and then used on roads instead of bitumen ? Maybe not in hot areas but certainly down south !\n",
      "Australia has vast uninhabitable land that can be used as landfill. But come on, recycle and reuse finite resources.\n",
      "Governments solution, don't invest in science, send to another country lol\n",
      "You can store electricity in salt water batteries. There are some already on the market. You can recycle any type of battery.The resistance to renewables is amazing.Try this. Sun in, electricity out for vertually zero cost, electrolysis into hydrogen, stored, though a fuel cell back into electricity and water.\n",
      "While the STC incentive scheme is in place, the Clean energy council (CEC) need upgrade the equipment safety standards encompassing a reusing policy! CURRENTLY IT IS ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL TO REMOVE AND DISPOSE of a 5year old system and replace with a new larger system and claim additional STC credits than just install an additional system to boost capacity.\n",

      "Long term effects I'm every aspect will benefit, if you don't agree then do some proper research into coal, wind farms etc and you will see that the impact of building them is ridiculous and they don't and can't keep up with growth. It's the only way to go.\n",

      "The time to go nuclear was really in the 1960's, but better late than never I guess. With the advances in reactor technology - especially from China - new reactors are being developed that are not only easier to manage safely, but some designs could make use of nuclear waste or non-enriched fuels. This certainly makes them a lot greener and cheaper to run in the long term.\n",

      "In the Australian context nuclear is expensive and unnecessary.\n",

      "BECAUSE ITS TOO EXPENCIVE. aside from all the other reasons\n",
      "One of the reasons for inaction on climate change and limiting the focus on that instead of the whole issue of environmental collapse and habitat destruction is the manipulation by vested interests with nuclear ambitions. It’s been about inaction ramping up extreme weather impacts to create an emergency mindset to justify nuclear or other options that vested interests can control and monopolise. This relates directly to vested interests being terrified of point of use small scale generation of power for households or relatively small communities who can own and control their power supply. \n",
      "It would take 30yrs to build up the infrastructure and skills to build and run a reactor.A more sensible, and doable, step is to build an enrichment industry first.
