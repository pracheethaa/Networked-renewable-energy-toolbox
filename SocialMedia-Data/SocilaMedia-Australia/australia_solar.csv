Huge amounts of lead, lithium and cobalt go into wind turbines and solar panel technology. This technology has a far shorter life span than nuclear, coal or gas for power generation.Plus, with wind and solar renewables, back up power and battery storage will always be required. Then you have the massive battery usage for electric cars on top of all of this. African countries are now becoming dumping grounds for vast amounts of disused solar panels laden with lead and other heavy metals. With nuclear, you get net zero emissions and reliable energy with modern modular reactors. I understand nuclear waste is already being stored in synroc a material invented by the CSIRO."

There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"The materials used in solar panels include silicon, copper, tin, aluminum and glass which are 85% to 95% reclaimed and recycled."
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,We faced a similar issue in the early 80’s with the increasing world wide popularity of motor vehicles and the treatment and disposal of lead acid batteries.
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"How about addressing the 50,000 unrehabilitated mines across Australia that the Mining Industry have just been allowed to walk away from, destroying our agricultural land!"
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"There is no technical barrier to fully recycling all components of solar cells and batteries. The same with virtually any manufacturered product. It's just a matter of will, and enforceable legislative actions to make it happen. There are costs, but these are offset by the savings in less need for new mining as materials are recycled as well as the obvious health and aesthetic reasons of eliminating waste."
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"So panels are recyclable, but let’s just say they weren’t, for arguments sake. the average Aussie person creates 1.5 tonnes of landfill per year (source- Greenpeace) and solar panels have a 15 year lifespan (approx). A family of 4 would create 90 tonnes of landfill in 15 years, so chucking 300kg of panels into the bin after 15 years is insignificant. Not that you need to, they’re recyclable. Nice work giving the solar naysayers a nice misinformed one line retort to their anti solar reasoning "
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"Congratulations to Griffith University for highlighting a question I've been asking for a few years now - what happens to all the solar panels and batteries at their end-of-life? It's time to start looking at other forms of energy generation - in earnest - it is unrealistic to continue using solar panels that gouge the earth of rare minerals that end up sitting on peoples' rooftops.  We have to find a sustainable solution.In the meantime, the waste generated from the current solar cells must be managed and recycled efficiently and affordably.  We need guiding legislation and bi-partisan government commitment."
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,No hurry. The world's been using nuclear for fifty years and we've no proper way to get rid of its waste. At least with solar the materials are recyclable.
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,Always thought solar energy could be implemented using the same model as mobile phones - monthly contract including maintenance and up grades. This way waste could be best on sold to recycling.
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"Nuclear concerns me as the waste is so toxic and we have  to find a suitable facility to store it.  Fukidhima was a modern, 100% safe power station.  There is no point saying it was in the wrong place, as the disaster  has already occurred.   Chernobyl  was a safe reactor, but it failed.  Five mile island? In the US, another safe one.  We also have to ask how much uranium  is left."
There's a looming waste crisis from Australia's solar energy boomAustralia urgently needs to prepare for a coming tsunami of solar panel and battery waste.,"Yes, we do need to get a lot better at recycling in general. The market has failed us, so it's up to government. Do we have a government that's up to the challenges?"

Sun in, electricity out for vertually zero cost, electrolysis into hydrogen, stored, though a fuel cell back into electricity and water."

"Australia receives the highest relative amount of solar irradiance of any continent.Whoopty doo, but what does it all mean, Basil?Here's an animation on how solar energy works for your Friday night, because we're quirky like that.","Do CSIRO actually advise the public on where to get these technologies? One of the main problems I have with trying to purchase is that the vendors approach is rarely via expertise in the technologies and usually expertise in sales techniques. And obviously they are not vendor neutral. I'd love a vendor neutral party (ie probably government funded) to be reviewing the market for consumer options. Its a big outlay in cash, the market is complex - eg what is reasonable re installation costs, state and federal rebates, technology options in capture and storage, manufacturer competence etc and hence purchasing confidence is low (imo).
