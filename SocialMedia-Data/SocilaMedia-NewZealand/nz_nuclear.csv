"The climate crisis calls for an examination of alternatives to our energy generation, particularly the peaceful use of nuclear power. A clean, sustainable, efficient source of power is essential.","They take ten years to build, cost about ten billion US dollars, and last about 40 years. Then they cost another half a billion to safely tear down."

Better to spend some of that money on domestic PV, solar farms and other smaller scale localised (and ideally community owned) generation. It’s the only way to reduce the cost to consumers."
Many experts believe fusion energy is the future of limitless clean energy - and one Wellington-based team aims to help New Zealand access this.,Billions and billions of dollars have been spent trying to get fusion to work. A few seconds of success that usually takes more input energy than the output. If it was reasonably achievable like fission it would have been found by now. Dream time it seems to me. Maybe there are good reasons why the nearest fusion reactor is 92 million miles away. What we should be trying to achieve is a greater solar power efficiency but there seems to be quanta reasons that tis tops out around 18 percent.

And more importantly who is going to fund this in NZ it will never be cost effective it will take billions to develop and we don't have it and it is presently not allowed in NZ.  Much respect for trying.

Fusion has been well-understood for decades, but turning it into a safe and reliable form of energy generation poses significant engineering challenges. Firstly, contain the reaction. Secondly, ensure you get more energy out than you put in over a sustained period of time. "

Many experts believe fusion energy is the future of limitless clean energy - and one Wellington-based team aims to help New Zealand access this.,"Excellent, clear, accessible interview with Ratu around one of the most exciting of many physics-based initiatives and industries in New Zealand. It perhaps highlights the breadth of careers available to physics graduates. Not only are the likes of Openstar and Rocketlabs hiring talent, but even bigger, global successes like F&P Health Care are reliant upon physics graduates for their growth. This all at a time when there are dwindling numbers taking up the subject. One time physics leader, Waikato University, which was once home to Dan Walls (after which the Dodd-Walls Centre of Research Excellence I used to lead is named), cut it’s undergraduate physics programme years ago. Massey University, where Sir Paul Callaghan originally worked, closed its BSc programme two years ago. Even Victoria University, where Ratu studied and which hosts the Robinson and MacDiarmid Institutes threatened closure of its School of Chemical and Physical Sciences. As it stands their programme in physics has been radically reduced with a watch on student numbers hanging like the sword of Damocles above the Department which would leave only Auckland, Otago and Canterbury teaching physics whilst our industry cries out for talent and opportunities to transform our economy and the world go begging.
