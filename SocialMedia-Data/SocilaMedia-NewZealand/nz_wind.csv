Last night I had the opportunity to meet with the Taranaki Offshore Partnership in Parliament to discuss wind energy. The potential for New Zealand is huge.,If taranaki loses oil and gas we be stuffed here be like taking farming out of taranaki no jobs no money

"VihanInvesting in clean energy and transitioning our economy to renewables is an opportunity – not a cost. We have a chance here to lead the world, and create thousands of new, highly-skilled jobs in the process. 

That’s why today’s announcement is so exciting. We are partnering with BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investors in climate infrastructure and clean technology, to launch a $2 billion climate fund. The fund will help to accelerate clean energy projects like solar, wind, green hydrogen and battery storage, and attract more investment in NZ as a climate leader. 

Our Government has taken more action on climate change in just the last six years than all other governments combined, but there is still more to do. Reducing our carbon emissions is no longer a ‘nice to have’ but an essential part of doing global business and having the goods to back up our clean, green image – and we’re here for the challenge.",Just so long as it doesn't cost the earth to consumers..... and right now it does!!! $400 a month to keep a home warm in winter!
