TotalEnergies launches its largest solar project in France,"From the article:

""The project plans to produce about 64 gigawatt hours of solar power per year

The photovoltaic solar power plant in Gien will have a capacity of 55 megawatts, producing about 64 gigawatt hours per year."""
TotalEnergies launches its largest solar project in France,"Good; tho france is dependant on NPP energy (also carbon free) due to being too north for much sun in winter -same height than canada- and not having enough hydro capacity. But every additional carbon-free bits help i guess https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/business/nuclear-power-europe-climate.html

(lets note that africa & asia are in a much better position for solar too; which is convenient as it means they can get more green electricity without risky tech transferts. Solar pannels/wind/etc are usually pretty safe politically too)"
Why Renewables Are Set to Become the Fastest-Growing Source of Energy - The Energy Information Administration sees a good two years ahead.

Why Renewables Are Set to Become the Fastest-Growing Source of Energy - The Energy Information Administration sees a good two years ahead. A new report claims that sources like wind and solar will provide 13 percent of the country’s total energy generation by 2020.,I don't recall the EIA ever making a somewhat accurate projection about renewables.
France approves 720MW of solar as price falls another 5%,"I don't think this is the best use of their resources. The Cour des comptes (court of audit) recently pointed out how billions are being spent on electricity-related renewable energy with very little result in terms on GHG emissions, while the gigantic opportunities for the decarbonisation of thermal processes is being ignored. They just go for what gives sexy headlines as opposed to what is efficient. 

I agree that the overall production will have to increase as the number of EVs go up, but investing on production now is too early, they'd better invest in upgrading their grid if they want to invest in ""electrons""."
"This is awesome: converting footsteps into renewable energy! (St Omer Station, France)","If this can recover 1/100th the energy it takes to manufacture, install, and maintain, I'll eat my hat.

1. Humans don't emit all that much energy.  About 100W, of which footfalls can capture only a very small fraction.  Most of human energy expenditure is exhausted as heat.
1. The design parasitically robs humans of energy.  Essentially this is a biofuel program requiring intermediate processing by humans into kinetic energy.
1. Out of doors, you'd recover vastly more energy from an equivalent area of solar panels.  Even the idiocy of Solar FREAKIN' Roadways would make more sense than this, if implemented as a solar _walkway_ (with vastly superior wear and damage aspects).  Though I _still_ think the best place for solar is _above_ the ground and _out_ of foot or vehicle traffic pathways.

Let's assess this based on the claimed efficiencies, power recovery, costs, maintenance requirements, material inputs, and capital expenses.

"Can window, solar and hydro power really power a whole country?","Of course it is, it's a matter of investment and government policies, so ultimately a matter of who you vote for in most places.

If you want 100% you'll need:

- end user storage, which you'll probably get if more people switch to electric cars with smart charging (two way charging). That means government incentive to buy electric cars or taxes on internal combustion engine.

- grid storage with second life used batteries and brand new batteries. Using full potential of hydro storage and developing new forms of storage.

- insulate people's home, especially in the poorest parts. So once again a matter of policies. Once you have a really well insulated home and it's heated with a heat pump the efficiency skyrockets and consumption comes down at the time the energy is most needed

- long distance energy trading. If it's windy in the UK and Sunny in Morocco or Italy, it doesn't matter if it rains in France as long as France can import. That requires a good relationship with your neighbors.

- use overproduction to generate hydrogen, either for long term storage or for heavy vehicles (boats, lorries etc)

All these solutions (bar R&D for new types of storage) are already available, and in some cases like sun and wind, cheaper than their existing alternatives. The rest needs injection of money to kick start the economy of scale."

"Mike Shillenberger gets taken to task: Germany's wholesale electricity among cheapest in Europe, while reducing CO2 output and growing GDP, and being a net exporter to inflexible nuke based France","Building new nuclear is a bad idea because:

- We still haven't figured out how to handle the waste, POLITICALLY; it mostly piles up next to power plants.  There are technical solutions, but we haven't used them, either for cost or political or arms-control reasons.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.  See for example http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s and https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/florida-power-company-exchanging-nuclear-plans-for-solar-plans-cutting-rates/ and https://thinkprogress.org/solar-wind-keep-getting-cheaper-33c38350fb95/ and https://thinkprogress.org/nuclear-power-is-so-uneconomical-even-bill-gates-cant-make-it-work-without-taxpayer-funding-faea0cdb60de/

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc.

Investing in renewable energy,"""Past performance is not an indicator of future performance""

Do you believe that renewables are still underpriced, given the focus on them recently (including this Forbes article, for example) and the oil price crash? Do you think the current incumbents, like Orsted and First Solar, will be the main beneficiaries of improvements in the renewable industry?

Just because an industry is likely to do well in the next few years doesn't mean the stock prices will do well - if that expectation is already priced in. The question is, what leads you to believe you know better than the overall market?"
"Cheaper than Nuclear, France has granted the biggest photovoltaic power plant in Europe","> The Cestas’ power plant today is the most powerful photovoltaic power plant of Europe.The Neoen plant’s 300 MW peak capacity is about one third of a nuclear plant, but a solar panel’s “capacity factor” – the amount of time it actually produces power – is around 10 to 25 percent, compared to up to 90 percent for nuclear plants.

this looks like a great project, but the article openly admits the lower energy production, compared to nuclear. So how can this headline be true? - seriously I think I must have missed something.

Wind power and solar photovoltaics found to have higher energy returns than fossil fuels,"Damn, there goes another talking point..."
Wind power and solar photovoltaics found to have higher energy returns than fossil fuels,"""The problem
Extracting energy from the environment requires an energy investment, such as to extract and refine oil, or to manufacture a wind turbine. A widespread view is that renewable energy systems require the investment of much more energy per unit of energy delivered than fossil fuels, leading to a low energy return on investment (EROI) — the ratio of energy delivered to energy invested. The implications of this situation would be far-reaching, raising the question of whether it is possible to sustain an industrial society under a renewable energy system. Yet, it is noteworthy that this narrative has been questioned by studies adopting equivalent analysis boundaries for fossil fuels and renewable energy at the final-energy stage (that is, the energy carrier delivered to the end-user, such as electricity or gasoline)1.

Previous studies, however, omitted the fact that renewable energy systems such as wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) yield a high-quality energy carrier: electricity. Electricity end-uses often have higher efficiencies than those of fossil-fuel-based carriers. By including end-use efficiencies, we extend the boundary of analysis to determine the EROI at the useful energy stage, which is the energy available after conversion of a final energy carrier in an end-use device (for example, a car engine)."""
Wind power and solar photovoltaics found to have higher energy returns than fossil fuels,"...and if we also  include energy equired for cleanup of any waste....Oh boy.

Why this is omitted in every study - thereby *massively* skewing the calculations in favor of fossil fuels - is beyond me.

If it is just that eroi of renewables is greater than fossils, yeah that is cool but not specifically significant. For renewables all that matters is that it is significantly higher than 1 and that you are cleaning up the energy mix used to create more renewables. Higher EROI for renewables just allow you to run that virtuous circle much faster and reach decarbonization quicker because now not even the energy used to create new renewables is carbon intensive if you use renewable electricity to produce more renewable tech. For fossil, no matter how high the EROI you will never reach decarbonization. But better to read the article then pontificate on Reddit ;-)"

Then, during the day, basically fans blew air over the ice to cool condition the indoor airtemps. 

Any technology using the surplus excess solar during sunny days to store that electricity as a useable “cold”.

Conversely — until we tap into the heat coming from data centers and reuse that heat as a commodity in industry (industrial laundry, breweries, etc.) — I’d there a technology to store surplus excess solar during sunny days to store that electricity as a useable “heat” (on a utility scale, not just those rooftop domestic water tank heaters, if they are still a thing)

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"> Afaik solar and wind will require trillions of dollars invested to supply current demand.

So will any other source.

Total annual electricity consumption globally is about 24,000 TWh, which at normal wholesale electricity prices of $50 / MWh is $1.2 trillion a year spent on electricity.

Investing trillions to replace the generation capacity for a $1 trillion / year global market is completely to be expected.

At current prices, replacing the entire global energy supply with a 50/50 mix of solar and wind would cost approximately $11 trillion, for a generation capacity that will last 25 years with no fuel costs and not very high maintenance costs. Assuming life-time maintenance and operation costs equal to the initial investment, that would be an effective cost for global electricity of about $0.9 trillion per year. 

Completely competitive with current prices.

Numbers just sound big because the global energy / electricity market is very large. 

&#x200B;

On the other side of things, solar farms generally have an installed capacity of about 50 MW / km^(2), which will produce 65 GWh / year of electricity in an average location.  In good locations, such as south west north America, Australian deserts, North Africa, Arabian Desert, Gobi Desert in China / Mongolia, big chunks of Brazil, Chile, etc, generation is more like 90 GWh / year or more from this 1 km^(2) solar plant.

At 90 GWh / km^(2), we can cover the worlds electricity use with an area of about 270,000 km^(2). It sounds like a big number, and IS a big number, but remember we are talking globally here. Cover 1% of the Gobi Desert, Sahara desert, Arabian Desert, Australia, desert areas of South-West NA, Brazil + Chile, and you have the 270,000 km^(2) area without straying into lower generation areas.

There are also something like 200,000 km^(2) of rooftops in the world, which, while they will be somewhat lower generation, could supply a large chunk of the generation capacity without any additional land use impact.

Capacity density for wind turbines is actually lower than solar, about 5 MW / km^(2) because of required spacing of wind turbines. However, direct land use is lower: turbines need to be widely spaced, but the land between them can be used for other purposes like agriculture. Currently, direct land use works out to be about 0.003 km^(2) / MW for on-shore turbines. Also, the amount of energy generated per year by wind turbines for a given installed capacity is higher, working out to about 3 GWh / MW of capacity (compared to 1.4 - 1.8 more typical for solar). This all means that you get about 15 GWh / km^(2) of wind farm area covered, or 1000 GWh / km^(2) of direct land use.

That means that covering the worlds electricity use with wind would mean wind farms covering 1,600,000 km^(2), but only directly blocking 24,000 km^(2) of land use. Globally, this is large, but not unachievable. It's about 1% of the global land area of wind farms. We could do that by dropping wind turbines into just 3% of the worlds agricultural land, while actually only blocking 0.05% of that land from agricultural use.

It's probably also worth noting that something like 16% of the worlds electricity use currently comes from hydro, which is renewable. This is unlikely to increase much further, but it does in principle reduce the amount of solar/wind we need to build out.

&#x200B;

The one other wrinkle that comes up is that electricity currently isn't the dominant world *energy* use. Only something like 25% of the worlds current energy use is from electricity. So if we want to replace all *energy* use by renewables, and not just all *electricity* use, the problem is larger. However, the total *energy market* is also larger, so economically, the situation stays about the same. For instance, the world consumes about 100 million barrels of oil per day, almost all of which go to non-electricity energy (such as transportation in cars, and heating). At $60 / barrel, that is an extra $2.2 trillion a year we are spending on energy. Natural gas consumption is something like 4 trillion m^(3) per year, at normal (pre-COVID pre-Ukraine) prices of about $0.3 / m^(3), giving a global market of $1.2 trillion annually, only 1/3 of which is used for electricity (most of the rest used for heating). If you add these to current electricity costs, global energy market is more like $4 trillion a year.

Furthermore, if we electrify transport (electric vehicles instead of gas ones), energy consumption for transport will drop by at least a factor of two (EVs are much more efficient). That alone drops world energy use by something like 12%. Heating is an even bigger fraction of global energy use, at around 50%, most of which is by combustion currently. Replacing this heating with electric heat pumps can reduce this energy use by a factor of 2-3, amounting to a 20% reduction in total world energy usage.

Adding these two together, we get something like a 1/3 drop in total global energy use from electrification. That means that to replace all energy use by electricity, the target is something like 64,000 TWh / year of electricity. 

That scales the cost up to about $30 trillion for building out a 50/50 wind/solar renewable grid, and land uses for each half of that of 360,000 km^(2) for solar (direct land use), and 2,100,000 km^(2) (total area) or 32,000 km^(2) (direct land use) for the wind half.

Overall if you assume 25 year lifespan, and total lifetime maintenance + operation costs equal to the capital expense, it's something like $2.4 trillion / year energy cost for running the entire global energy market on solar + wind, compared to the current $4 trillion global energy market. To cover intermittency, you might want to bump the solar+wind generation up by 50% or so, which brings the cost to $3.6 trillion / year. Still less than current costs for energy. And the cost of both wind and solar has continued to come down in recent years.

&#x200B;

**In summary, it is both economically feasible and land-use feasible to cover all of the worlds energy use with a mixture of solar and wind at current project prices.**"

Here's a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/SarahLynnBurch/status/1511009927640371200) by someone who claims to be one of the lead authors on the IPCC report. 

For a very basic summary:

- We don't think we can completely stop all fossil fuel use by 2050 _while continuing economic growth_ and allowing increased standards of living in poorer countries - but it can be massively drawn down. Coal must stop and all other fossil fuel use must be abated with carbon capture.

- The vast majority of new primary energy production will come from solar and wind, but other renewables and nuclear power will also play a smaller role.

- Insulation, reduction of food waste, reduced need for transport, and other draw-downs of demand will offset part of the continued increase in electricity need. (Personal note: All these reductions in demand are incredible cost-savers, and that they're not already being done everywhere is a failure of our political and economic system.)

- Investments are high, but must increase approx. 300-600% to meet targets.

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"What’s the issue? Coal, gas etc all require both capital and large operational investments? You can google it, but wind and solar are consistently providing the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) over the life of the asset. You also need to remember that both oil and gas are volatile, and you run the risk of no supply or steep costs you cannot forecast. 

The way around this is that a lot of project developers are taking on the risk of financing and owning the assets and are selling the power on long term contracts to the utilities. People are investing because it’s cheaper than coal and still companies are making money. Brookfield Renewables is a $30bil company. There’s money to be made."

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"The short answer is yes. Wind and solar are abundant and cheap. In most parts of the world they are now the cheapest new build options to generate power. They don’t rely on finite fossil fuel inputs and are not subject to geopolitically sensitive fuel supplies and prices. Their primary energy inputs are practically infinite. They don’t produce greenhouse gas emissions or local air pollution. There are other renewable alternatives too. Hydro power is one, but in most parts of the world the potential for hydro power has been exhausted. Tidal power is another, but so far nobody has figured out how to scale it and make it cheap. Same goes for nuclear fusion. If you care about climate change at all, you need to care about cumulative greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, which means we need to start cutting them as soon as possible. Because wind and solar are cheap and scalable today, it makes the most sense to deploy them first and foremost as fast as possible. We may need another complement for them in the future when our power systems near 80% plus wind and solar share, but that point is likely decades away (unfortunately)."

Discussion avec r/de: La Politique Énergétique,"The big misunderstanding for people comparing nuclear to renewable is scale, people underestimate how much a nuclear powerplant produces and therefore overestimate the negatives compared to the ones of other energy sources.

So just to put thing in perspective let's take good old Fessenheim as a reference from before it was closed down.

Fessenheim produced annually 11679 GWh of electricy with 2 medium-large reactors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fessenheim_Nuclear_Power_Plant)

To produce 1MWh of electricity per year with solar panel you'll need around 8 m^2 of solar panel (https://www.lepanneausolaire.net/comment-calculer-puissance-d-installation.php)

So to produce as much as good old Fessenheim you'll need around 100 km^2 of solar panel, the surface area of the city of Paris covered by solar panel with no spaces in between

BTW a solar panel is approx 3kg (without framing) per m^2 so we are talking about 300000 tonnes (~600 TGV) of electronic waste to recycle after the 25-30 years life expectancy of the solar panels.

In comparison a large nuclear reactor produces around 25-30 tonnes of used fuel annually (https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx) so Fessenheim would have produced 1250-1800 tonnes of spend fuel during that time, most of which is actually recycled in la Hague, close to 300 time less in weight. Sure electronic waste do not result in nuclear waste, only good old heavy metal and chemical waste, but still toxic waste you wouldn't want in your backyard that will need to be disposed of safely."

What is driving this phase-out in Germany, is it fear ? Do you view nuclear energy as outdated ? Do you view it as necessary to fight climate change ? Do you think it is more important than reducing your emissions?

Discussion avec r/de: La Politique Énergétique,"Seeing as energy is among the biggest infrastructure around in our societies, wherein your usual plans don't go for 10 years but rather 25 to half a century,

(for efficiency, coherency, cost, international might in selling projects but most importantly geopolitical power and energy independence like the US, obviously for R&D re. fusion breakthrough and renewable-s efficiency, etc etc.)

I guess my bias shows already, energy is big money, as big as government projects get, and so it strikes me as obvious that most European countries, even the biggest like ours, might be struggling at their relatively ""small"" scale, when there's a 500m-ish market of consumers and businesses out there, supposedly free and ready to be tapped into like it's fucking *2021* (and with this pun on *1999*, I mean that IMHO we need to get real, get serious, and stop messing around clumsily like 20 shades of special snowflakes, because this is a critical topic)."

How is the Masters in Energy Environment at Ecole Polytechnique ?,"I don't knows about the quality, certainly good. However a degree from ecole polytechnique will help you to find a job easily."
How is the Masters in Energy Environment at Ecole Polytechnique ?,"Don't know about this particular master. But Ecole Polytechnique is the best engineering school in France, so it is probably great, and it would be a highly valuable line on your resume anyway.

We have less solar and wind than Germany, Denmark, and so on, because we already have most of our electricity generated by nuclear energy. But they're definitely taking off, and there's a lot of jobs to be taken in this field. And don't forget Belgium, where half of the people speak French, and which wants out of nuclear energy.

Plus, things may change soon in France. Since nuclear is not very popular, the governments had not launched other nuclear plants projects for a long time. President Macron finally launched 6 projects in 2021, but they will take time, and our current plants are getting really old. We have had a huge debate on our electricity mix this winter, because lots of nuclear plants were down for maintenance, so prices were high (gas prices were high too so that didn't help) and we were afraid of electricity shortages. So in this context, maybe renewable energy will get a boost from investors and government decisions, but it's too soon to say.

And don't forget non-electricity renewable energy (biofuels, methanisation...). And France also launched a program for developing green hydrogen. So lots of employment prospects here too.

Hope that helps !"

----

 Auditionné à l'Assemblée nationale, Patrick Pouyanné, le PDG de TotalEnergies, a estimé qu'il faudrait « beaucoup, beaucoup plus d'électricité que ce que l'on a [prévu, ndlr] dans nos trajectoires » si la France veut exporter de l'hydrogène décarboné. Selon lui, la production d'hydrogène propre, une activité sur laquelle TotalEnergies veut se développer, nécessite forcément un surplus conséquent de production électrique.

Selon le PDG de TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanné, la construction de six nouveaux réacteurs nucléaires, voulue par Emmanuel Macron, ne suffira pas, si la France souhaite produire de l'hydrogène décarboné, c'est-à-dire de l'hydrogène produit à partir d'électricité renouvelable ou nucléaire, sur son territoire. « Ce n'est pas nos six réacteurs ou dix réacteurs qu'il faut faire si on a l'ambition de faire de l'hydrogène décarboné en France, il faut en faire 15 ou 20 », a-t-il lancé devant les députés de la commission d'enquête de l'Assemblée nationale, réunis ce 23 novembre pour « établir les raisons de la perte de souveraineté et d'indépendance énergétique de la France ». Un ordre de grandeur, dont la fourchette basse correspond au plan de relance du nucléaire du gouvernement en comptant les 8 nouveaux EPR en option.

« Notre parc [électronucléaire, ndlr], il faut le renouveler pour assurer la disponibilité d'électricité aux Français car on a des centrales âgées. [...] Si la France a l'ambition d'être un exportateur d'hydrogène, il faut construire beaucoup, beaucoup plus d'électricité que ce que l'on a [prévu, ndlr] dans nos trajectoires », a-t-il avancé. Selon le dirigeant, dont l'entreprise ambitionne de devenir un acteur majeur dans la production de cette molécule considérée comme stratégique pour la neutralité carbone, « on ne peut pas parler d'hydrogène, si on ne parle pas de surplus d'électricité ». C'est d'après lui, « la limite de l'hydrogène vert ».
Hydrogène et surplus d'électricité

Alors que l'électricité représente actuellement 25% du mix énergétique de la France, cette part devrait passer à plus de 50% à l'horizon 2050 afin de décarboner l'économie. Pour produire suffisamment d'hydrogène localement, « il faut ajouter 50% de capacités [électriques, ndlr] de plus, d'après les calculs qu'on a faits, à l'horizon 2050. C'est énorme », estime Patrick Pouyanné. « C'est un vrai sujet. Il ne faut pas se tromper sur les trajectoires que l'on prend. Cela renvoie à des politiques locales », souligne-t-il.

La France défend une production locale de l'hydrogène décarboné tandis que de nombreux pays, l'Allemagne en tête, entendent importer de très grands volumes d'hydrogène pour décarboner leur économie depuis des régions du monde disposant d'énergies renouvelables très compétitives. Alors que cette vision d'un commerce longue distance de la molécule verte ne fait pas l'unanimité, notamment pour des enjeux de souveraineté, elle suppose aussi de relever des défis techniques et économiques.

Faut-il importer massivement de l'hydrogène vert ou le produire localement ? Le débat fait rage

« On ne croit pas beaucoup au développement de méthaniers à hydrogène », a indiqué Patrick Pouyanné lors de son audition, rappelant que « l'hydrogène liquide se transporte très mal » car il doit atteindre des températures extrêmement basses, proches du zéro absolu. Le patron de la multinationale mise plutôt sur le transport d'hydrogène incorporé dans des produits semi-transformés, comme de l'ammoniac vert et du méthanol, dont le transport par navire est plus accessible.
Un réseau européen d'une centaine de stations hydrogène

« L'économie de l'hydrogène n'est pas une économie simple, nous n'en sommes qu'au début », a-t-il reconnu. Selon lui, il faut avant tout comprendre la demande et en distinguer deux types : la demande locale pour décarboner des sites industriels, où la question de son transport ne se pose pas, et la demande dédiée à la mobilité terrestre, plus complexe à appréhender.

Hier, TotalEnergies et Air Liquide ont annoncé un partenariat autour de la production d'hydrogène sur la raffinerie de Grandpuits, actuellement en reconversion. Air liquide va investir 130 millions d'euros pour construire et exploiter une unité de production alimentée en partie par du biogaz issu de la bioraffinerie. Les quelque 20.000 tonnes d'hydrogène produits par an seront achetées par TotalEnergies et serviront surtout à la fabrication de « SAF », du carburant d'avion « durable » au bilan carbone inférieur à celui du kérosène.

Ce mercredi 24 novembre, le PDG de TotalEnergies a également indiqué prévoir la construction d'un réseau à l'échelle européenne d'une centaine de stations de recharge hydrogène à destination des camions. En revanche, Patrick Pouyanné estime que la place pour les véhicules légers à hydrogène sera « marginale », les constructeurs automobiles s'orientant largement vers la technologie à batterie."

Le ""succès"" qui devient une obligation légale surtout, ça joue un peu dans le ""succès"". La question principale c'est de savoir si ça contribue à la décarbonation, donc est-ce que pendant les pics de production de solaire (notamment en été) on va consommer davantage d'électricité et moins d'énergies fossiles, ou est-ce qu'on va ""stocker"" cette électricité, ou ne pas consommer d'une autre source d'électricité qu'on consommera davantage à un autre moment. J'ai quelques doutes sur ces sujets, les pics de demandes actuels sont l'hiver le matin et la soirée de jours froids, et en dehors de ces moments il n'y a pas de tensions excessives sur le réseau.

Ce qui compte c'est les résultats: (1) Consommer moins d'énergie fossiles (2) (a) Produire davantage d'électricité (b) qui ne pollue pas davantage.

Pour le (1), difficile d'anticiper, c'est pourtant l'essentiel. Pour le (2.a) on peut douter vu la trajectoire prise depuis des décennies. (2021: 530 TWh, 2003: 530 TWh). Pour le (2.b) on peut douter vu que l'électricité actuelle émet déjà peu. C'est sur ces critères que j'utiliserai le mot ""succès"".

L’accord est signé, mais la CGT continue de bloquer. Il ne lui faut pour cela qu’un minimum de bras. Lundi matin, TotalEnergies dénombrait 90 grévistes sur l’ensemble de ses sites touchés par le mouvement social (trois raffineries, deux bioraffineries ainsi que le dépôt géant de Dunkerque). Ces six sites comptent à eux tous plus de 3400 salariés. Et encore s’agit-il d’une veille de journée nationale. La CGT a battu le rappel, selon une source proche du dossier. C’est là tout l’art opératif de la CGT: l’effet de cette grève semble complètement disproportionné par rapport au nombre de personnes impliquées. Dimanche, le président du Medef, Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, a ainsi regretté que les «150 personnes des raffineries prennent les Français en otage», dimanche au micro de Radio J. Et le patron des patrons d’appeler à la réquisition.

Paradoxalement, le très faible nombre de réquisitions de personnel lancées la semaine dernière et ce lundi par le gouvernement montre bien qu’il suffit de très peu de monde pour bloquer la distribution de carburant en France. Seuls 13 opérateurs ont été rappelés au travail à coups de décrets préfectoraux lundi pour permettre d’écouler les carburants stockés dans les raffineries de Feyzin et le dépôt géant de Dunkerque pour les équipes du quart de 14 heures à 20 heures. La semaine passée, seules deux réquisitions par jour avaient suffi, mercredi puis jeudi, à faire sortir les précieux carburants de la raffinerie de Port-Jérôme. Le site, exploité par Esso- ExxonMobil, a repris le travail vendredi. «Nous ne cherchons pas à faire redémarrer les raffineries, mais à déstocker leurs réserves de carburants très fournies», explique-t-on au sein de l’exécutif.

Pour ce faire, les réquisitions ont ciblé les stratégiques services des expéditions, qui ne peuvent tourner qu’avec deux agents bien formés. «Bloquer une raffinerie, ce n’est pas compliqué: il suffit de bloquer le quai d’empotage où sont remplis les camions de transport de carburant et connectés les pipelines, explique de façon générale un ingénieur du secteur. Et pour ce faire, il suffit que l’un des deux opérateurs sur ce quai soit en grève pour empêcher le chargement.» De plus, contrairement à la RATP ou la SNCF, où les cadres peuvent endosser des rôles opérationnels sur le terrain en cas de grève, le management des raffineries n’a pas les habilitations pour remplacer les opérateurs.

Une raffinerie comme celle de Port-Jérôme compte environ 500 salariés, et environ deux fois plus avec les sous-traitants. L’unité en charge des expéditions est d’ailleurs aussi en charge des «bacs», ces grands réservoirs cylindriques visibles de loin, qui contiennent pour deux à trois jours de carburant. À noter, une raffinerie peut continuer à tourner alors que ses expéditions sont à l’arrêt. Elle remplit alors les stockages sur site.

Une dizaine de jours pour retrouver un fonctionnement normal

S’il suffit de deux grévistes pour stopper les expéditions, il en faut davantage pour bloquer la production d’une raffinerie. À Port-Jérôme, où travaillent 400 opérateurs (ceux qui manient les machines sur le terrain) sur un bon millier de salariés, la direction comptait entre une quinzaine et une vingtaine de grévistes à la prise de chaque quart en début de semaine dernière (mais la grève a été définitivement levée ce vendredi). À Fos-sur-Mer, il a suffi le 27 septembre de onze grévistes, sur une centaine d’opérateurs et 300 salariés, pour stopper la production de la petite raffinerie qu’y exploite aussi Esso-ExxonMobil. Le fonctionnement est similaire dans les raffineries de TotalEnergies.

Le personnel dans les raffineries travaille par équipes de quart, 7 jours sur 7. Chacun possède des compétences techniques particulières et des habilitations pour manipuler telle ou telle installation. Pour chaque poste, il y a sept salariés qui se relaient. Il est donc très difficile de les remplacer. Certes, il existe des opérateurs «volants», capables de remplacer au pied levé des collègues absents sur différents postes. Mais pas en période de grève. «Personne ne veut passer pour un “jaune”, un casseur de grève à la solde du patron», explique un autre professionnel du secteur.

Une raffinerie complètement à l’arrêt nécessite une dizaine de jours pour retrouver un fonctionnement normal. Celle de Port-Jérôme, qui a redémarré vendredi, ne pourrait donc pas tourner à plein avant le milieu de la semaine prochaine. La situation dans les stations-service pourrait toutefois s’arranger bien avant. En effet, explique une source industrielle, «les stocks de carburant de la raffinerie, qui sont pleins, seront ponctionnés en attendant que l’usine retrouve un fonctionnement nominal». Pas de crainte, ajoute la même source, car «il y a suffisamment de stock pour cela»."

J'ai regardé la vidéo de total. Et pour eux énergie verte = énergie renouvelable. (On peut débattre)

Scientifiquement parlant, des minerais d'uranium sont systématiquement importés pour nourrir nos centrales. Ce sont des minerais fini et non renouvelable.

Qu'est ce qu'une énergie renouvelable? Les énergies renouvelables représentent les énergies dont le renouvellement est rapide à l’échelle humaine, par opposition aux énergies fossiles qui ont mis plusieurs millions d’années à se former.

Maintenant la question c'est : est ce que les solutions de la transition énergétique doivent être que des énergies renouvelables. A mon avis non."
"Oui, le nucléaire est une électricité verte",[deleted]
"Oui, le nucléaire est une électricité verte","Total est engagé dans les énergies renouvelables, ce n'est pas étonnant qu'ils fassent du lobbying et de la désinformation en poussant ça + gaz au lieu de nucléaire."
"Oui, le nucléaire est une électricité verte","Le nucléaire est une réussite française et c'est une honte qu'on nous impose des ENR quand on n'a aucun (quasiment aucun, il reste des centrales à charbon et fioul) problème à corriger.

Les ENR en complément du nucléaire oui, mais fermer des centrales nucléaires puissantes (beaucoup plus puissantes que les ENR) pour avoir des ENR et centrales à gaz non merci."
"Oui, le nucléaire est une électricité verte","Merci !

Et pour compléter rapidement :

* Le [nucléaire est la source d'énergie la plus sûre](https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy) : 0.07 morts / TWh produits (contre plus de 30 pour le charbon par exemple).Elle est même [plus ""safe"" que l'éolien et le solaire](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2013/09/29/forget-eagle-deaths-wind-turbines-kill-humans/#64be1ef95467). De loin et même en comptant les 3 accidents nucléaires ""majeurs"".
* Sachant que dans les accidents majeurs, Three Miles Island n'a fait aucune victime, Fukushima non plus (les morts ont été liés au Tsunami, aux procédures d'évacuation...). Pour [Chernobyl](https://ourworldindata.org/what-was-the-death-toll-from-chernobyl-and-fukushima), l'ONU donne quelques milliers. Quant on compare à la mortalité attendue du changement climatique ([qui tue déjà 150 000 personnes/an](https://www.who.int/heli/risks/climate/climatechange/en/), et ça va augmenter), c'est bien peu.
* On parle de déchets ? La gestion des déchets nucléaires c'est un défi ridicule à côté de l'adaptation et de la réduction du changement climatique. Si on peut relever le défi climatique, à côté les déchets nucléaires c'est finger in the nose. Et quant on sait que [les déchets des centrales à charbon sont plus radioactifs que ceux des centrales nucléaires](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/) mais qu'on s'en fout, ça fait un peu ""double standard"".
* D'ailleurs le [volume de déchets du solaire et de l'éolien](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/10/759376113/unfurling-the-waste-problem-caused-by-wind-energy) va rapidement poser problème, et les filières de recyclage ne sont pour le moment pas à la hauteur des enjeux.
* ... de même que les métaux rares nécessaires à ces derniers, créant des enjeux géopolitiques et une dépendance aux importations bien plus prégnante que pour le nucléaire
* ... de même que leur dispersion et la [nécessité d'artificialiser des sols](https://sciencing.com/negative-effects-solar-energy-6325659.html) (par exemple, 1 MW de solaire nécessite 500 fois l'espace au sol de la même puissance installée en nucléaire) avec des conséquences sur la biodiversité (déjà problématique en Californie), la capacité de ""puit de carbone"" du sol, l'usage agricole...
* ... de même que les authentiques mensonges sur leur ""faible"" coût au KWh basé sur un indicateur inadapté aux énergies intermittentes, le [""Levelized Cost of Energy""](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCOE), qui sous-estime largement le coût du solaire et de l'éolien et [les font artificiellement paraître plus compétitives économiquement qu'elles ne le sont en réalité](http://economics.mit.edu/files/6317).

Donc oui, le nucléaire, même si ce n'est pas parfait, a quand même beaucoup d'atouts.

Surtout si on considère les avancées futures : les [Small Modular Reactors](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/small-modular-reactors-nuclear-smr-1.5187469)ont un bon potentiel pour décarboner l'énergie...

Mais alors pourquoi cette source d'énergie a t-elle si mauvaise presse ? [Serait-ce parce que Greenpeace (et d'autres ONG) serait financé depuis des décennies à hauteurs de millions de dollars par des lobbies d'énergies fossiles ?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/03/28/the-dirty-secret-of-renewables-advocates-is-that-they-protect-fossil-fuel-interests-not-the-climate/#2ed54e551b07) Groupes pétro-gaziers qui maintenant se convertissent au renouvelable (intermittent) avec force greenwashing... ce qui leur permettra de continuer à vendre du gaz...

En résumé, nucléaire + un peu de renouvelables + beaucoup de sobriété énergétique, c'est ce qui me semble le plus réaliste pour lutter contre le changement climatique.

Pour l'instant la Chine est un très bon exemple d'empilement des énergies. Faire des éoliennes et du solaire en masse quand on consomme 30 PWh d'énergies fossiles c'est facile. Quand ils seront à 0 on en reparlera. Et ce qui est vrai pour eux est vrai à peu près partout ailleurs.

Il faut toujours considérer que cette hausse rapide des ENRi à laquelle on assiste actuellement n'est aussi pas indéfinie. Aujourd'hui si on veut augmenter de 100 GW l'éolien, on a plein de fossiles, et on a juste à installer 100 GW. Dans 20 ans si on veut augmenter de 100 GW d'éolien, on est censé avoir beaucoup moins de fossile, et il faudrait installer 200 GW d'éolien (100 GW pour remplacer celles qui seront en fin de vie + 100 GW de neuf). Ce double effet baisse d'énergie fossile + remplacement n'impacte pas ces systèmes actuellement. Et plus ces systèmes ont une durée de vie faible, plus ils seront impactés."

Energie : la France se prépare à une économie de guerre,"La France fait un grand pas vers l'économie de guerre, en tout cas pour ce qui concerne le secteur de l'énergie. La loi pouvoir d'achat , présentée en conseil des ministres mercredi 6 juillet, comporte un volet «souveraineté énergétique» qui attribue des pouvoirs sans précédent à l'Etat pour faire fonctionner les infrastructures gazières françaises comme il le jugera indispensable cet hiver. Elle compte plusieurs dispositions «relatives à la sécurité d'approvisionnement en gaz et en électricité», selon une version provisoire du texte transmise aux «Echos».

Le gouvernement se prépare ainsi au scénario d'une rupture d'approvisionnement total en gaz russe , jugé hautement probable désormais. Première mesure d'exception, la loi autorisera l'Etat à dicter la conduite des centrales à gaz s'il le juge nécessaire, passant outre les mécanismes de marché en vigueur en temps normal.

**Suspendre les centrales à gaz**

«Le ministre chargé de l'énergie peut décider temporairement de restreindre ou suspendre le fonctionnement de certaines installations de production d'électricité utilisant du gaz naturel» afin d'économiser les précieuses molécules. En cas de menace sur l'approvisionnement en électricité, l'Etat pourra aussi « les réquisitionner afin qu'elle fonctionnent selon ses instructions». Les exploitants des centrales à gaz - EDF, Engie et TotalEnergies -, seront indemnisés le cas échéant.

Deuxième disposition clé pour passer l'hiver, le gouvernement pourra forcer le remplissage des stockages souterrains français de gaz si le système en vigueur n'est pas assez efficace. Il aura également la possibilité de fixer «une trajectoire de remplissage minimal», explique le projet de loi. Si cette trajectoire ne peut pas être respectée, les opérateurs du stockage (Strorengy, filiale d'Engie, et Teréga ) devront constituer eux-mêmes les stocks nécessaires. Là encore, le gouvernement prévoit d'indemniser les opérateurs si cela leur fait perdre de l'argent.

**Importer davantage de GNL**

D'autres dispositions visent à accélérer l'installation d'un terminal flottant d'importation de gaz naturel liquéfié (GNL) de TotalEnergies dans le port du Havre. Le gouvernement vise une mise en service en septembre 2023 pour accroître nos capacités en vue de l'hiver 2023-2024. Un calendrier serré qui suppose de passer outre une série de procédures et d'autorisations susceptibles de retarder les travaux (raccordement au réseau de gazoducs de GRTgaz, aménagement du port...).

Plusieurs dispositions du code de l'environnement ne s'appliqueront pas pour accélérer la construction du tuyau de raccordement reliant le port au réseau gazier. Les fouilles d'archéologie préventive seront autorisées, mais elles devront être réalisées «dans un délai compatible avec la date de mise en service impérative du projet fixée par le ministère chargé de l'énergie». L'Etat pourra imposer «le maintien en exploitation» du terminal «pour une durée de trois ans, renouvelable». 

Dérogations au droit du travail

Le texte comprend des mesures du même acabit pour l'électricité. Des dérogations au droit du travail sont en particulier prévues pour assurer une « reprise temporaire des installations de production d'électricité (…) pour faire face à des difficultés d'approvisionnement en énergie susceptibles d'affecter la vie de la Nation ».

La centrale à charbon exploitée par Gazel Energie à Saint-Avold (Moselle) est visée. Mise à l'arrêt de façon définitive fin mars 2022, celle-ci se prépare en effet à reprendre du service cet hiver pour venir au secours du réseau électrique. Grâce à ces dispositions exceptionnelles, Gazel devrait être en mesure de conclure des CDD ou des contrats de mission d'une durée étendue par dérogation à un maximum de « trente-six mois » avec ses ex-salariés licenciés pour motif économique ou en congé de reclassement."

PARIS, 22 mars (Reuters) - La major pétrolière française TotalEnergies a déclaré mardi dans un communiqué qu'elle n'achèterait plus de pétrole et de produits pétroliers russes.

Elle a également indiqué qu'elle veillerait au strict respect des sanctions européennes contre la Russie, actuelles et futures, quelles qu'en soient les conséquences sur la gestion de ses avoirs en Russie. (Reportage par GV De Clercq. Montage par Jane Merriman)

A chaque fois qu une nouvelle source d énergie a été trouvée, elle n’a jamais remplacé les anciennes. Elle s’est juste ajouté au mix. 

On n’a par exemple jamais extrait plus de charbon qu’aujourd’hui malgré toutes les alternatives moins polluantes qui existent. 

Si on veut diminuer les émissions de carbones, il faut construire autant de sources d’énergie qui en émettent moins qu’il est possible de faire, en un minimum de temps. 

Cad autant de centrale nucléaire possible, autant de photovoltaïque possible, autant d’éolien possible , etc, etc

Nous n’avons plus le luxe de faire la fine bouche. Nous ne pouvons plus choisir. Il faut construire de tout le plus vite possible pour que la production decarbonnée augmente plus vite que la demande mondiale et que l on puisse alors mettre les plus polluants à l arrêt."

L'autre crainte est qu'on focalise tout sur le nucléaire plutôt que de continuer à bosser sur des alternatives (let's face it, si on part là dessus, les études vont se multiplier, les commerçants autour du domaine aussi, et du coup on fera plus que ça).

Et je suis persuadé que c'est une erreur, une forme de pansement, qui n'adresse toujours pas le problème de fond qui est vivre différemment et plus en accord avec notre planète (vœux pieux, je sais).

Ensuite $10000 c'est vraiment pour une demi journée d'urgence. 
J'ai eu une hernie hiatale ma première semaine aux US: $5000 , et ils m'ont laissé repartir avec une boîte d'opiacés (genre vicodin) pour faire partir la douleur.
Ma fille a eu un épisode asthmatique intense qui a été traité en soins intensifs, 3 jours, $130000 (dont 4000$ d'ambulance pour 5km), ma femme a eu une ablation de la vésicule biliaire $160000 (opérée et sortie le même jour de l'hosto).
Les accouchements en général ça coûte aussi dans les 50000, mais si il y a des complications (par exemple des jumeaux) ça peut dépasser plusieurs centaines de millier aussi.
Heureusement, il y a des assurances mais les franchises sont assez haute (entre 5000 et 10000), et double: 1 franchise par individu et 1 pour la famille.

Plus ça va, plus on les baise. Le système cherche à tirer du profit, ou à limiter énormément le coût de la santé, alors il y a moins de moyens dans les services de médecine et le personnel est à bout.

A notre niveau, il n'y a pas grand chose à faire, si ce n'est de considérer ces personnels à leur juste valeur en les respectant et en les remerciant pour leur travail.

Pénurie d'electricité: Peut-on éteindre l'éclairage public?,"Je suis conseiller municipal dans une petite commune rurale d'un peu moins de 4000 habitants.
Il y a environ un an on a décidé de couper l'éclairage public la nuit. Du dimanche soir au jeudi soir extinction à 23h30 et le weekend extinction à 1h39. Rallumage le matin à 5h30. 
Au passage on a changé les ampoules pour des led là où c'était possible. 
Résultat, la facture a été divisée par 2 pour la commune. 
Durant l'été le syndicat d'électricité nous a informé que le tarif allait être multiplié par 3, on a donc consulté nos concitoyens et on a étendu l'extinction, désormais ça coupe de 22h à 6h tous les matins."
Pénurie d'electricité: Peut-on éteindre l'éclairage public?,"Je préférerais qu’on coupe les panneaux publicitaires et les magasins. 
Quand je vais au travail la nuit ou que j’en reviens, voir la promotion sur tel ou tel article c’est le dernier de mes soucis."
Pénurie d'electricité: Peut-on éteindre l'éclairage public?,"Je commente juste pour donner mon avis, je travaille pas dans le secteur et j'habite dans une grande ville ou la lumière n'est pas coupée : je pense qu'il faudrait faire plusieurs choses à mon avis a savoir :
- remplacer les ampoules par des LEDs,
- mettre des systèmes de détecteur de mouvement pour allumer les lampadaires que quand c'est nécessaire,
- forcer les enseignes a couper la lumière (coucou les apple store qui sont entièrement éclairés en pleine nuit alors que fermés et vides)"
Pénurie d'electricité: Peut-on éteindre l'éclairage public?,"Je crois que certaines villes avait mis des détecteurs de mouvement.

Bon moyen de couper quand ça sert pas, tout en gardant la lumière si quelqu'un passe."
Pénurie d'electricité: Peut-on éteindre l'éclairage public?,"La pénurie en cours n'est pas une pénurie d'*énergie*, mais de *puissance*. Le problème n'est pas d'avoir de l'électricité entre 22h et 6h du matin : à ces heures-là, la plupart des gens dorment, et ne consomment pas. Le problème est d'avoir de l'électricité pour tout le monde aux heures de pointe, typiquement le matin entre 7h et 8h et le soir entre 19h et 21h : c'est le moment où tout le monde tire sur le réseau, et c'est là que ça risque de coincer.

Donc, aussi bien intentionnées que soient les mesures telles que couper l'éclairage public ou les panneaux publicitaires, ce n'est pas ça qui va aider à éviter la pénurie cet hiver et les coupures chez les particuliers. Sur le long terme, bien sûr, ces mesures seront utiles, dans une optique d'économie d'*énergie* (parce qu'à terme on va en manquer), mais pour l'instant ce n'est pas ça le problème et ça ne peut pas servir de mesures d'urgence."
Pénurie d'electricité: Peut-on éteindre l'éclairage public?,"À ma connaissance, l'électricité se stocke très mal, elle doit donc être générée au moment où elle va être consommée.

Réduire la consommation la nuit ne change a priori rien à la capacité de production aux pics de consommation de 8h à 12h et de 18h à 20 h.  


edit: je suis d'accord sur le fait que réduire la dépendance au gaz/charbon et à l'importation d'énergie est une bonne chose, je parlais juste de l'impact de réduction la nuit sur la production aux heures de pics."

Moi dans ma commune hors métropole l'éclairage est coupé la nuit et c'est clairement pas gênant. Les villes alentours font de même. Par contre les horaires sont pas fous : le soir ça coupe a 20H30 (21h30 en heure d'été, je pense qu'ils s'embêtent pas à changer l'heure) et 6h30 le matin. On aimerait bien que ça soit 22h-6h, ça serait un peu plus pratique. Et qu'ils changent les lumières aussi, on est encore sur les affreuses lumières oranges, sauf une petite zone ou ce sont des boules blanches pas tellement plus jolies et qui éclairent vers le haut en plus.

"Falling for a French man, and confused on where we stand","In France being completely transparent about how you feel in the very beginning of the relationship can be considered unappealing.
It's just a cultural thing thought, but it results with us conditioned to maintain a fog about the relationship until a late step.
For example it totally not abnormal to live two weeks straight at his flat without knowing if you're a couple or not.

This aside, your situation seems to be more complex than just a cultural trait and you should just talk to him."
"Falling for a French man, and confused on where we stand",He sounds like he has deep feelings but wants to experience how it is living with you. He clearly said he wants a relationship with you (« we ll make better memories »).
"Falling for a French man, and confused on where we stand","He spent one month traveling with you. He's exclusive. You talk everyday. You guys are in a relationship. It may not be labeled as one, but it's a relationship.

There are several possibilities as to why he's, in words only, non-committal. He could be your stereotypical afraid of commitment person. Maybe his long term relationship ended in such a way that he's extra wary of committing. Or maybe he knows that a relationship means you moving to Europe for him and that's a lot of pressure for something ""recent"".

  
In any case, I think he's making logical sense in his approach. If you want both to keep this relationship going long term, at some point someone will have to move in the other one's country and finding out if you can live together as Parisians is a great step for that. Only thing I would say is: you need to find a common way to communicate. Long distance or not, a relationship can't work out if you can't find a way to talk to each other. But this can come along as well.

Hope this helps. Cheers"

3. The panels will remain free from dirt and rubber - thus more efficient.

4. The panels don't need a rough surface on the top, optimal clear glass can be used - thus more efficient.

5. The panels provide shade and rain cover to cyclists, thus encouraging cycling!

This installation uses 176 tiles, so I get… $677,600. By comparison, generating that much electricity with solar panels would cost well under $5,000 installed, and would last 20 years instead of 5.

To be cheaper than the [plummeting] price of solar, the cost would have to come down to under $5/tile, a 99.999% reduction. Solar only needs to drop about 50% in order to become the cheapest source of energy.

The key word is ""demonstrateurs"", demonstrations. French are doing what makes sense, investing into R&D and pilot projects, to move renewable energies past their current ""mostly useless"" status forward, so that these sources can be in future more useful. 

This is to contrast with embarrassment in Spain, Germany, Austria, and other countries, which decided to lavishly subsidize industrial scale deployment of the current inefficient wind/solar technologies. Such policies in effect do nothing but waste money to insure future demand for burning of the most scarce fossil fuel, natgas. Therefore it is hardly a surprise to find politicians who forced these decision, after leaving the elected office, on the payroll of major oil/gas companies. 

This distinction between financing R&D + demonstration projects, versus financing industrial scale development of immature wind/solar plants, is what distinguishes smart versus stupid energy policy. "

I honestly don't understand how conservatives can handle this level of cognitive dissonance, on the one hand claiming that free-market, laissez faire style capitalism is a core principle and at the same time be all too happy when a conservative politician undertakes a massive government interventionist policy that severely impacts the free markets. On the one hand, unregulated or under-regulated capitalism is a hill they've decided they will die on (which is insane, but whatever), but on the other hand they're really happy that we get a government-led trade-war with allies that is costing the US good jobs. The money in paychecks from green jobs spends just as well as the money from coal, so is this really just as petty as owning the libz? Or is this just the insane cult around the inept, intellectually un-curious, ignorant, narcissistic president?

French bank's calculations of the energy return on capital invested shows that oil is now in 'relentless and irreversible decline' for light-duty vehicles,"That’s not true, not even by a long shot.  First, the cost to produce things say such as a wind turbine have come down dramatically, sadly we still can’t utilize them fully and are only able to operating at about a 3rd of the time.  This is due to the fact they generate power that can not be transferred (in mass quantities) or stored. We do not have the electrical grid in North America that can transfer the power they generate. In addition to that, we can’t store the power they do generate when the demand is low.  

If you were to drive by a wind turbine far you see only a few operational at a time. Making wind power to costly to manage and sustain. This drives up the cost, making the energy production cost far higher than oil or coal. 

Now apply this to powering a car.  Here is another nasty little secret, you are being mislead when it comes to the future of electric cars.  If our electrical grub can’t support the transfer of wind or solar power and we have no current working storage systems for retaining the power that is generated. How is every vehicle going to run on electricity?"

"I'm anti-nuclear, because these are the only arguments I know. Please enlighten me on the ""pro"" position.","1.  CO2 emissions are insignificant compared to the coal plants these would replace.
2.  Just because it is not the whole solution does not mean it cannot be part of the solution.
3,4.  The best argument, but still, if you consider the full cost of coal, including pollution, nuclear is more competitive.  While renewable sources may be more cost effected, they run into your #2 big time -- which is why we need a comprehensive solution including wind, solar, and nuclear.
5.  Storing nuclear waste is not that hard, it is much easier and less harmful to the environment then storing coal waste.
6.  I'm not convinced, more uranium will likely be found.  42 years is a long time, by then we may have Thorium reactors, economically viable seawater extraction, or something else.
7.  It is far safer than the coal plants they would replace.  I am not convinced they are inherently unsafe -- they have gotten safer over the years -- a modern plant has never killed anyone.
8.  Not really a relevant argument in the first world
9,10,11,12.  All of these problems are either even or far worse with coal.
13.  Nuclear power in the first world in no way detracts from wind power in the 3rd world.

In summary, the OP's analysis fails to compare nuclear with the coal plants it would supplant.  I too prefer wind and solar, but they can only grow so fast and have problems dealing with base demand.  Nuclear is an excellent complement.  "
"I'm anti-nuclear, because these are the only arguments I know. Please enlighten me on the ""pro"" position.","I definitely *wouldn't* rule out nuclear as an option for future energy generation.

The best argument I've heard suggests that nuclear capacity should be maintained at its current rate. In other words, new nuclear reactors should only be built to replace old reactors that close down. This should help maintain uranium reserves, although as the supply of uranium becomes less plentiful and harder to extract the cost of using it will go up. It also should help finding suitable sites for new stations, since in many cases they can be built in the same location as the reactor they're due to replace.

Most of the problems with nuclear - safety risks, waste disposal, construction over-runs - are engineering problems that have known solutions. Unfortunately, these solutions don't come cheap. However, putting in place a suitable renewable energy network that can handle baseload demand could be similarly expensive. Nuclear generation will benefit from the rising cost of carbon (just as renewables will) and may be a more attractive option in the next few years.

In the UK, the Scottish parliament has ruled out building any new nuclear reactors. This makes sense, since Scotland has ample opportunity for wind, wave and tidal energy generation. A big majority of the UK's renewable energy targets are likely to come from Scotland. The south of the country is less fortunate, and it also happens to be where energy demand is highest. Siting new nuclear stations close to areas of high demand will mean fewer transmission losses. Unfortunately, that means more additional costs due to the higher land value.

A few caveats. Before any new nuclear reactors are built, a thorough study should be done of all the costs (and emissions) involved over the entire life cycle of the plant, especially with regards to decomissioning old reactors. This will allow a fair and honest comparison to be made between nuclear power and the alternatives. Plans should be in place for suitable disposal of waste - most of the UKs nuclear waste is still in temporary storage waiting permanent storage in a facility that has yet to get off the drawing board, which is a disgrace.

Although I'd put wind, solar, hydro and tidal energy before nuclear given the choice, I've a feeling that the shift in thinking to enable our emissions targets to be met will be too much to rely on renewables alone. Even though you're not looking to make the comparison with coal power, there may not turn out to be much choice.

France Faces ‘Substantial’ Costs If Renewables Wipe Out Nuclear,"[1]

(Bloomberg) -- France faces “substantial” costs and technical challenges if it wants to replace almost all its aging nuclear plants with renewable energy by 2050, the International Energy Agency and the country’s grid operator said Wednesday.

In a report commissioned by the French government, the IEA and Reseau de Transport d’Electricite highlight the need to scale up new technologies and adapt the legal framework to ensure that a network dominated by variable wind and solar generation remains reliable at all times.

The government is targeting a power mix that’s about 35% wind and solar in 2035, up from about 10% last year. While the grid can cope with that, France will need more backup production and energy storage if that share is going to expand much further, the report showed. The country must also consider potential public opposition to large wind and solar farms and new power lines.

“All the costs associated with a high share of renewables, including the costs of storage, demand-side flexibility” and grid development, “might be substantial in France after 2035,” the IEA and RTE said in the report.

State-controlled Electricite de France SA currently has 56 nuclear power stations in operation, with a production capacity of 61 gigawatts, typically producing almost three-quarters of the country’s output. It plans to shut a dozen plants by 2035, and most of the rest by 2050.

While President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of building new reactors to replace some of those retiring, he has deferred a decision until after 2022’s presidential election. Some opposition parties, such as the Greens, are against new atomic plants, pointing to rising costs at EDF’s current nuclear projects in France and the U.K., as well as environmental risks associated with operating the the generators and storing spent fuel."
France Faces ‘Substantial’ Costs If Renewables Wipe Out Nuclear,France has an electricity deficit in the winter and surpluses in the summer due to all the nuclear that they have. They import/export electricity from other EU countries to accommodate the different demand side v the steady domestic supply side. The EU should build out the European HVDC network to further balance supply and demand across Europe.

Why France is eyeing nuclear power again,"I know nuclear power is a popular meme on reddit, but there is a reason its being abandoned globally; its that it is expensive and does not offer anything over renewable energy

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618300598

""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""

It is also not remotely economical, as of the latest LCOE (levelized cost of energy) nuclear is over 3x more expensive than wind and solar. This means a given dollar figure of investment will give 3x as much decarbonization if invested into wind and solar instead of nuclear.

https://www.lazard.com/media/450436/rehcd3.jpg

Nuclear has never even been economically viable, it is never been done, anywhere without massive government support:

""Most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world, where there is a competitive market for electricity, has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated. Only where the government or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered.""

renewables are subsidized less:

https://htpr.cnet.com/p/?u=http://i.bnet.com/blogs/subsidies-2.bmp&h=Y8-1SgM_eMRp5d2VOBmNBw

And after all the subsidies nuclear has received, it is still not viable without subsidies, meanwhile wind and solar have many examples of subsidy-free projects

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/subsidy-free-solar-comes-to-the-uk

With the overall lower subsidies to the renewables industry, they have transitioned to being viable without in a very short period of time, compared to nukes which literally remain subsidy junkies 50 years after their first suckle at the government teat.

Renewables even make better use of subsidy dollars; the same amount of subsidy invested in renewables vs nuclear will give many times more energy as a result.

""Global reported investment for the construction of the four commercial nuclear reactor projects (excluding the demonstration CFR-600 in China) started in 2017 is nearly US$16 billion for about 4 GW. This compares to US$280 billion renewable energy investment, including over US$100 billion in wind power and US$160 billion in solar photovoltaics (PV). China alone invested US$126 billion, over 40 times as much as in 2004. Mexico and Sweden enter the Top-Ten investors for the first time. A significant boost to renewables investment was also given in Australia (x 1.6) and Mexico (x 9). Global investment decisions on new commercial nuclear power plants of about US$16 billion remain a factor of 8 below the investments in renewables in China alone. ""

p22 of https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20180902wnisr2018-lr.pdf

meanwhile, a study on nuclear economics show:

https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.670581.de/dwr-19-30-1.pdf

and summarized here

https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/07/24/nuclear-a-poor-investment-strategy-for-clean-energy/

""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry. The post-war period did not witness a transition from the military nuclear industry to commercial use, and the boom in state-financed nuclear power plants soon fizzled out in the 1960s. Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""

The results of this is that in 2017 there was over 150 GW of wind and solar coming online, but nuclear:

""New nuclear capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 was outweighed by lost capacity of 4.6 GW.""

https://energypost.eu/nuclear-power-in-crisis-welcome-to-the-era-of-nuclear-decommissioning/

Renewable energy is doing more for decarbonization than nuclear.

Now the inevitable response is ""muh storage"" but

Renewables+ compressed air storage is already cheaper than nuclear

https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/1821297/liquid-air-storage-offers-cheapest-route-to-24-hour-wind-and-solar

""“For a 100MW system, we are already touching [a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of] $100 per MWh today,” chief executive Javier Cavada tells Recharge. “In ten years from now, I can see that being $50/MWh. That's very doable.”

By comparison, a new pumped-hydro plant would have an LCOS of $152-198 per MWh, with a comparable lithium-ion system costing $285-581/MWh, according to analyst Lazard.

With a new gas-peaker plant having a levelized cost of energy of $156-210/MWh, and wind power at $30-60/MWh (according to Lazard), it may already cheaper to balance the grid using wind-powered liquid-air storage than fossil-fuel technology. And if the LAES system is “charged” using wind power that would otherwise be curtailed, the wholesale price of that power would be close to zero.""

So we already have renewable+storage that is cheaper than nuclear.

Nuclear does not even work as a compliment to renewable energy.

It is a myth that a baseload generator like nuclear, ie something that makes a continuous output, is needed with VRE (variable renewable energy).

What you need is something capable of quick ramping up to fill in the gaps when no sun or wind. (batteries, Hydrogen, gas)

Nuclear is already expensive, and if wind and solar are cheaper 50% of the day (when there is wind or solar essentially), that means one would only need nuclear to provide ""baseload"" 50% of the time.

Except nuclear price is made up of initial capex more than fuel costs, so turning off a nuclear plant for when it is needed does not save money. What it means is it now has only 50% of the time to make the same money as before, so the price now doubles to the customer. Which is why nuclear will never fill the gaps in renewable energy, it is already expensive, and will only get more expensive the more renewables come online

Nuclear is a square peg for the round holes in the future energy grid.

Its decline will continue

Why France is eyeing nuclear power again,"\>  [Some were still surprised](https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1184529090604392448?s=20) that France is forging ahead with large EPR reactors instead of [small, modular ones](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608271/small-reactors-could-kick-start-the-stalled-nuclear-sector/) that might significantly cut up-front costs and development risks.  
But Lovering and [others noted](https://twitter.com/PROUSTEric1/status/1184221759685439488?s=20) that with the first EPR plants coming online, the industry has developed expertise, supply chains, and design refinements that should help cut costs and reduce the time it takes to develop subsequent reactors.  
“Rather than starting over with a new design, I think they’re trying to learn from the failures of the first one and improve on the next generation,” she says.

I really hope this will work out. They need a successful project to prove themselves. Europe needs these reactors especially during winter times."
Why France is eyeing nuclear power again,"> The nation produces more than 70% of its electricity from nuclear power,

That could have been America, had we built the entire reactor fleet we originally planned on.

Newsom rules that California schools and farms cannot use their own solar energy production,"Here is his veto message if you're curious why. The referenced article seemed a little biased, so I thought I would look a bit deeper. I still don't feel I know enough but it's nice to see his reasoning.

***I am returning*** *Senate Bill 137 4 without my signature. This bill requires the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), by July 1, 2025, to revise electric rate tariffs for customers in multi-unit residential and nonresidential buildings and public schools with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on their property to allow for account-level netting.*

*California has provided policy and financial support for the customer solar PV market over the last two decades. Support that created the largest customer solar PV market in the country. Given the market's exponential growth and significant cost declines in solar PV systems, it is appropriate and prudent to realign the subsidies provided to customers who choose to install these systems at the expense of customers without solar PV systems.* 

*This is why the CPUC facilitated a robust, public decision-making process over the last several years to revise the applicable electric rate tariffs that provide these rate subsidies to customers with solar PV systems. The revisions adopted by the CPUC from this process focused on aligning these rate subsidies with the measurable value these systems provide to the electric grid and towards furthering the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. This endeavor stems from the growing need to address the affordability of electric bills for all customers.* 

*While I support the continued growth of the customer solar PV market, this bill would compound the challenge of electric bill affordability by overturning a key component of a recent CPUC decision adopting these alignment changes. Specifically, this bill would increase the amount that most customers would pay for their own electric service to provide a rate subsidy to certain customers, and public schools, that install solar PV systems on their property.* ***For these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.***"

Top 10 Countries using Renewable Energy in Electricity Production From the Year 1990 to 2017,That is excellent.  Thanks for putting it in perspective.  I can see New Zealand has done a commendable effort.
Top 10 Countries using Renewable Energy in Electricity Production From the Year 1990 to 2017,"After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and  tsunami in Japan, the Japanese government stopped all the nuclear power  plants and promoted renewable energies to make up with the nuclear  energies. One of the renewable energy sources is biomass power and many  biomass power plants were built since the earthquake. 

The Japanese  government has been promoting to use domestic species, Japanese cedar,  for wood usage by providing several forest-related industries with a  large amount of subsidies.

Now as a result, many forests are  harvested due to the increased demand for wood biomass. Many of those  areas have not been replanted. You can see many bare lands in the  Japanese mountains. 

I think it is necessary to make an environmental law in  Japan that requires replanting trees after harvesting forests if Japan  wants to maintain healthy, sustainable forest.

California cuts payments to homeowners for solar panels feeding energy back to the grid,[deleted]
California cuts payments to homeowners for solar panels feeding energy back to the grid,"The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday passed a proposal that will reduce compensation provided to households for the surplus electricity their rooftop solar panels contribute to the electric grid.  
  
Utilities and consumer groups have argued the incentive payments have unfairly favored wealthier consumers and harmed poor and low-income households. But solar companies and renewable advocates have said that lowering the compensation would slow solar installations and hinder the state’s goals to address climate change.  
  
The proposal, which California utility regulators unveiled last month, will change a net metering policy by paying solar owners for extra power at a lower rate, which is determined by the cost the utility would need to spend to purchase clean power from an alternative source. The solar industry has said the plan would amount to a 75% cut in average payment rates to customers.  
  
Today’s unanimous vote by the five-member commission was monitored across the country, since California is widely viewed as a leader in the renewable energy buildout. The impact of today’s decision will likely extend beyond the state and have implications for the solar industry nationwide, particularly companies in the residential solar space like Sunrun, SunPower, Sunnova, and Tesla.  
  
More than 1.5 million homes, businesses and other utility customers in California have rooftop solar panels. The utilities commission estimates that these installations can collectively produce 12 gigawatts of electricity.

"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.",Australians take note!  Maybe we will build our nuclear plants and not need to fire them up.
"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.",Nuclear power plants can not be shut down just like that. That is misleading. You can only stop the turbine but then the chain reaction will still continue. That energy has to go somewhere so you have to cool a lot with water and control rods. It's not a on and off switch..it takes weeks to actually shut it down.
"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.",This again. Who is it on Reddit who uses negative prices as a scare tactic on a weekly basis?
"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.","So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

First, reactors can be shut down almost instantaneously. This is for safety. They do keep producing about 8% of their heat though after shut down for about a day. This is removed by, usually, just bleeding steam to the turbine generators, but there are backup methods to this, again, for safety.

A small-ish portion of a nuclear power plant's daily operating cost comes from fuel consumption. A huge portion of the daily operating cost for fossil fuel plants come from fuel consumption. So it's not very cost effective to shut down a nuclear reactor.

As for how long it takes to start up and shut down nuclear plants, it does take awhile if you want to avoid emergency methods. But this is something that was designed in to allow the plants to operate with lower enrichment and large size. If you have a plant designed differently, like with a smaller size, this allows rapid changes in load. Rapid changes in load may become more desired now that renewables are a wide-scale thing. This allows nuclear plants to quickly adapt to changing demand profiles caused by wind and solar variations while still keeping energy green.

Basically, small size nuclear plants are a green solution to make up for the gaps needed to be filled by changing renewable power production.

As for the excess power produced. France just needs to invite companies in that have needs for energy but can take advantage of low grid demand. For example, turning seawater into pure water is energy intensive, but you could only switch those on during peak solar hours. Same thing for producing H2 and O2 gas from H2O. Same thing for producing cryogenic liquids. Same thing for smelting metals (although, I'm not 100% sure about that one). Basically, there are lots of industries that can now pop up in France to take advantage of this negative energy cost."

Spirituality: The Bottleneck to Sustainability (Essay - Copyright to OP),"This post is, to say the least, intellectually admirable. Your framing of the task of sustainability as a spiritual problem resonates quite strongly with my own perspective, honestly. I see mankind’s environmental negligence as being rooted in a kind of intemperance, or to put it otherwise, a lack of discipline over our impulses and desires. I read Brave New World years ago but have yet to read Island; I’ll be sure to. Thank you for sharing your mind. You have one new follower."
Spirituality: The Bottleneck to Sustainability (Essay - Copyright to OP),"Could you elaborate a bit on the link with spirituality? Not criticizing, I think I'm just missing the link.

Regardless, you do make great points on the environmental impacts of denuclearization. To add to your points, the death toll from fossil fuels is much greater than that of radiation. There are issues with having these nuclear power plants though in areas with instability in nature (from storms, earthquakes, flooding, etc.), though there are plenty of other places around the world in desolate areas that offer this security to construct new generators."
Spirituality: The Bottleneck to Sustainability (Essay - Copyright to OP),"Beautifully written, well-structured and properly referenced: well done.

  
That being said I could not disagree more with your opinions, albeit respectfully. I have nothing to say about spirituality because I am a pragmatist. I care little of believe systems and dogmas, and less of those who preach them. But I read Huxley’s Island quite fondly and appreciate the way you link to it.

  
In my modest view, the nuclear paradigm is a story of lobbying and power, not in the least invested in the energy transition. Insisting on this technology, despite its enormous costs and severe limitations is short-sighted. That being said, I could accept that existing nuclear plants may continue operation until they reach their decommissioning date, since lignite and coal (the complete exploitation of which are Germany’s pragmatic economic interest) are doubtlessly a worse alternative. Fossil gas is problematic as well and should certainly not have made it in the EU’s Taxonomy, neither.

  
The problems with nuclear are manyfold, so I’ll voice a few, which will certainly encounter strong criticisms. To set a level playing field, allow me to clarify that I use a current baseline, i.e.  technologies that are in operation at scale today (rather than sci-fi dreams which are always 30 years in the future).  
•	Nuclear Power produces electricity. Electricity amounts to a fraction of total energy demand. There are better ways to produce electricity, which have a fuel cost of zero, which will therefore always result in a better economic outlook. Electricity, like you said, may be used to produce fuels, but using power electronics, rather than steam-driven turbines, bypasses one conversion step, making it more efficient.

  
•	Nuclear power is inflexible and ill-suited to backup renewables, often leading to curtailments. Fossil gas is on the opposite side of the spectrum here, which is why even the IEA recognizes it as a ‘transitional’ necessity.

  
•	Nuclear power is ‘addictive’. France will never be able to phase it out: her entire energy system revolves around it. EDF is state owned and heavily indebted – but artificially kept alive - because they employ and train thousands, allowing France to project a technological supremacy. France is also the only EU member state to have failed to meet her 2020 renewable energy targets. 

  
•	Nuclear power is linked to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. France and the UK are the only European powers to wield their own nuclear armaments, as well as the means to deliver them. 

  
•	Nuclear fuels are scarce, mined at enormous costs for the environment (much like other critical materials to be fair) and found in a limited number of countries - some of which are ‘problematic’ to say the least. A nuclear renaissance would rapidly lead to price hikes and potentially depletion.

  
•	Nuclear deployment is tediously slow (especially compared to renewables): building new plants takes an amount of time which we simply don’t have if we plan to stay in the IPCC’s 1.5 trajectory.  
  
TL;DR:  It does not necessarily make sense to phase-out the existing nuclear fleet, but the basis for expanding it is lacking: costs, fuel availability and roll-out time are not functional to the immediate needs of the required energy transition."

"Many people are using the Ukraine conflict as an example of why nuclear generated electricity is dangerous, but that misses the bigger picture about how fossil fuels kill millions each year, while nuclear barely kills any","Another opinion I'm really disappointed in how many ppl support, is that many politicians are using the Ukraine conflict to say that fossil fuel production needs to increase so that there is a domestic supply instead of relying on another country which wouldn't be apply to supply in times of war. 

However, that's the wrong approach. In order to prevent dependency on another country's fossil fuel supply, the best solution is not to increase your own country's fossil fuel production, it is to reduce fossil fuel use, period. There is no need to tap into domestic fossil fuel or foreign fossil fuel if there is no need for it in the first place."
"Many people are using the Ukraine conflict as an example of why nuclear generated electricity is dangerous, but that misses the bigger picture about how fossil fuels kill millions each year, while nuclear barely kills any","I always send people the Kyle Hill video about nuclear power. It’s super safe, can reuse generation one reactors spent fuel and we have enough of that stored AT current facilities to fuel new gen reactors for 100 years. People don’t realize the advancements made in the technology. Just don’t build the plants on god damn fault lines or flood plains."
"Many people are using the Ukraine conflict as an example of why nuclear generated electricity is dangerous, but that misses the bigger picture about how fossil fuels kill millions each year, while nuclear barely kills any",I understand what you're saying.

It's a great program and the best part is getting a 4 year degree at 2 year degree costs.
"Question: What sites, or universities, or countries are doing the best innovation for sustainability?","University of Tasmania has partnered with Climate Foundation to build Australia’s first kelp platform using deep water welling techniques. Kelp forests like these regenerate ecosystems,  draw massive amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, and have enormous potential as a sustainable source of all kinds of products - from eco friendly plastics to biofuels to methane-reducing cow feed.

Here’s a cool video about the project: https://youtu.be/GMtFSM4271g

"Question: What sites, or universities, or countries are doing the best innovation for sustainability?","The Netherlands by far. Almost 50% of their country is below sea level and so are the country in Europe most vulnerable to climate change. They've used windmills  for centuries to pump water out and natural systems to make the areas into arable land, and from what I've seen are laser focused on extracting every ounce of wasted efficiency out of product and energy cycles."
"Question: What sites, or universities, or countries are doing the best innovation for sustainability?","Western Europe has amazing sustainability programs that are more progressive then majority of the US; university of Edinburgh, Oxford, lots of universities in France and Germany.

What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"If we can change some of our energy use cycles, we can use more energy directly and store less. There's a few % of inefficiency in an energy storage system. The more we can sidestep that, the more energy is available. eg if we use energy generated while the batteries are topped up, we can gain a couple of % bypassing the batteries."

What’s the real question you’re looking for an answer to?"
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"What do you mean by ""needs to be stored""? Stored for what purpose?

70% of my states electricity comes from wind and solar. In summer, it often reaches over 100%, and the excess is sold to the eastern states. 

We had what was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world, 129 MWh and 100 MW. That was then expanded to 194 MWh at 150 MW.

The battery is not there to run a town for an extended period of time, or anything like that, it's just to keep the flow of electricity stable, to minimise blackouts. 

Instead, the backup for the grid is supposed to come from home solar. 30% of houses here have solar panels, thus they have a battery."
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"The excess energy needs to be stored, the rest can be used."
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"This is a very complicated question and it depends on many factors. You also need to be clear on what it is you're actually asking.

For example, if we relied on wind 100%, the question would be: how many hours or days in a row with negligible wind could we have before the storage ran out?

So there won't really be one answer. The more storage we have (plus the more consistent our production and consumption is) the longer a grid could withstand dips on production."
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"Do you just mean how much solar and wind energy has to be curtailed because there is not demand for it at that moment?

"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔","It's well known that wind farms and solar plants generate more energy than can be used on sunny/windy days, and it can't be stored. So either it's turn it off and stop generating energy, or it goes to waste. Literally can't be used. A huge flaw in the system just now but hopefully it will be solved"
"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔","Fingers crossed we find better ways to handle surplus beyond just storage, personally I like the suggestions that we reasonably overbuild wind and solar capacity and when we have prolonged grid surpluses, beyond what can be stored, we make useful materials or capture carbon dioxide."
"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔",Use the excess to capture carbon inefficiently from the atmosphere!!
"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔","Hot take, but let's not oversimplify the issue.  Distributed solar (ie, rooftop) is referred to as ""grid edge"" power because it's produced out on the edge of the utility's distribution network (power lines, etc).  There are a lot of great things about this, such a reduced transmission losses, but there are also downsides.

Solar energy is (obviously) produced in a cyclical fashion, dependent on the availability of sunlight.  But electricity consumption is not based on the availability of sunlight, it's based on users.  When production and consumption don't perfectly align, the utility needs a way to balance supply and demand.  Batteries are one way to do this, but at the scale required by a municipal utility this isn't a realistic solution (yet?).  Instead, they rely on electricity generation that can be scaled to demand, such as a fossil-fuel based peaker plant.  These days, that's probably natural gas.  Wind, hydro and nuclear are not good peaker plants, because they can't be turned on and off quickly.

However, even fossil fuel based electricity generation needs to be ""on"" for long enough to be commercially viable.  When excess solar energy drives electricity rates low or into negative territory, it makes it impossible for a fossil fuel-based power plant to remain online/in business.  Now, you might be saying ""great, that's what we want!""  Except without this option to smooth out unequal electricity supply and demand, we've now created a power distribution system where there is NO power available when there are fluctuations in demand.  That is to say, brownouts and blackouts.

I don't believe this is an insurmountable problem, or one that should discourage the development of new small-scale solar installations.  As it stands, consumption far outstrips demand and it is rare for on-site renewables to produce significantly more power than is used on-site.  However it is a legitimate concern that requires careful implementation of large-scale solar power while utilities transition into fossil-fuel-free solutions to even power distribution.  Incidentally, all this relates to the arguments about net metering also, but that's another topic."
"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔",This is a perfect example of our global economic model is in direct opposition with sustainable energy. Sustainable food production for that matter as well.
"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔","You guys are radically misunderstanding what the original tweet is talking about...

When more PV electrons are being sloshed into the system than electricity is being demanded, you **have** to ramp up and down in complicated ways so as to not harm physical assets. The ramping is expensive. 

It wouldn’t matter if it was operated by the government or w/e, you’d still have to ramp, and it would still be expensive, and instead of representing a claim on the economy via retail electricity rates it would be more income paid in taxes or something (or just the same effect on retail rates, either or)

This problem is part of why storage is so valuable.

You guys really need to read into stuff before you fly off the handle"
"Sorry, we can’t have renewables because they work...too...well...? 🤔","Unfortunately it’s true. The financials for solar power make less and less sense as you install more. Market electricity prices change as the supply and demand change, and if you’ve got a glut of energy at any particular time then the price goes way down. If it goes down enough you significantly extend out the time to recoup the investment, and in extreme cases you can fail to make your money back.  Beyond a certain level the market won’t drive solar installations as they don’t make any money.

This is also the reason the “cost per kWh” comparisons you see don’t actually tell you the whole story. Solar at half the cost doesn’t help you out if the electricity can only be sold for a quarter of the price that more expensive but flexible power generation can generate (like in the evening when solar wanes but demand is still reasonably high)."

How to advocate for solar energy in the Biden infrastructure bill,"Please actually do this and write to local government in as many numbers as you possibly can. People need to know above anything else that yes, this can WORK. It is viable.

The technology to store excess energy exists. It's been made just not mass produced. We have liquid metal and liquid air batteries that are capable of it and affordable at scale to take excess from the grid anywhere between 70 to 80 percent efficiency, through companies like Ambri and Highview Power that desperately need to get further off the ground. And Heliogen is making concentrated modular Solar refineries (CSP) at affordable costs that can be scaled up to meet larger electricity needs. This CAN be done and the construction of all of them is quicker than any plants we have with close enough output to them.

The fear of blackouts and lack of power at night and such when excess energy storage is on the horizon and portable, modular nuclear reactors are becoming a thing is becoming more and more unfounded as days go by, and these things need to become part of the plan going ahead. But these companies and these kinds of ideas need backing. The quicker these technologies are put into mass production the better. Things can really get mobilized after that. Get loud about it. Spread the word that they exist and that they and others fill the gaps we need for renewables to sweep the grid."

Climate change migration _will_ be necessary, but for those who can stay put, there are a lot of advantages.  Having an established community that you can depend on makes a big difference.

Also, I'd recommend watching The Biggest Little Farm on Hulu which shows a fully organic and Regenerative farm in a region North of Los Angeles and by farming this way, you'll have a really healthy piece of land with soil that will catch and retain tons of water instead of how traditional farms can't take in much water which leads to soil erosion and flooding during heavy rains.  Which it also seems like we will be getting bigger and more severe storms because of climate change and need soil that will catch and retain more water and preventing severe runoff.  And if you're going to build anything, I'd recommend using old shipping containers or something similar to build shelter out of instead of new wood construction.  Good luck!"

Why don't people talk about using landfill waste as an energy source more often?,Singapore burns trash for power. As i understand it's very expensive to ensure the exhaust gases are not filled with hazardous chemicals
Why don't people talk about using landfill waste as an energy source more often?,"There are several ways to use waste for energy. 

Currently, many landfills in the US already capture and burn methane for power. Several countries in Europe compost food waste and use the significant waste heat to heat municipal water, or city areas."
Why don't people talk about using landfill waste as an energy source more often?,It’s my understanding that methane from landfills has a slightly lower btu value than ‘natural gas’ and that’s why it’s often burned onsite for power. That said it’s better to capture it and burn it for power than let it release to atmosphere.
Why don't people talk about using landfill waste as an energy source more often?,There are a lot of garbage incinerators around the world. Some cleaner than others but lots. Waste to Energy.
Why don't people talk about using landfill waste as an energy source more often?,"The following covers US regulations on waste to energy or waste processed for alternative uses like agriculture:

1. All “traditional” landfills built since 1979 have had emissions control regulations that have required construction that allows flammable gas collection and/or venting which have evolved to allow two options for treatment of these emissions—direct “flaring” (burning of said emissions) or use in landfill gas energy production in either gas turbines or reciprocating engines for electricity generation.  Burning of such gas is better from both general pollution concerns and from a greenhouse gas perspective as CO2 emissions from both flaring and energy production has less of a greenhouse impact than methane and other gasses produced in landfill conditions.  One problem with landfill gas production for energy production is that it takes several years to build up to consistent supply of gas for combustion in a new landfill and when a landfill operation is terminated the supply eventually runs out.  So it is difficult to efficiently manage such emissions in the early days and late days of a facility.  This does not mean that running energy production is not cost effective; it just means that it only works well several years into an operation and eventually stops working as a consistent source of energy in the later years of an operation.  There are currently about 1,250 active landfill operations in the US and roughly 530 of them have LFG energy production.  Another rough 460 of them are suitable for installing such systems.

2. Aerobic decomposition of yard waste and food waste in municipal composting operations produces far less in the way of greenhouse gases (34-84% less methane emissions depending on method) and the byproducts can be used as fertilizer or simple carbon amendments to soil as alternatives to synthetic fertilizers (the production of which carries a significant emissions and warming potential).  So on a net basis using organic composting is a better source for agricultural soil amendment than synthetic fertilizer.  Similar math applies to the production of organic fertilizer from Class A municipal sewage treatment compared to synthetic fertilizer, but this requires rigorous controls on what is permitted to enter the sewage system.  (Sewage plants can also utilize waste gas energy production as an alternative to flaring and this can typically cover at least part of the energy requirements of sewage plants.

3. Most Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) that is used in trash burning operation (as in Europe) needs to be dewatered and burned as a fraction of total fuel supply.  In the U.S. incineration fell into massive disfavor after passage of the Environmental Protection Act and the Clean Air Act back in the 1970’s which made it very difficult to get public support for such operations thereafter despite the introduction of far better, far cleaner incineration technology.  Regardless, ground breaking tech was introduced into burning toxic waste in cement kiln operations roughly 30 years ago.  This was so successful that (combined with reductions in toxic waste production) the supply of this material has dried up.

4. It is an open question as to the net enviornmental cost benefit of disposing of plastics via incineration.  The tech exists to scrub toxic emissions from doing this, it would reduce microplastic pollution, but it would result in CO2 emissions.  Trying to implement such systems would require a lot of convincing environmental activists and the general public.

5. The hazardous and toxic elements of incinerated waste are, contrary to most opinion, a lot easier to contain than the leachate from landfills and other containment systems.  In short the high complex carbon content of cinders from incineration binds toxic materials to carbon molecules making such materials hard to leach.  (I could go on about this topic for a long time and I don’t want to imply that this is cure all to toxic waste management.  My goal is simply to correct the commonly held belief that burning stuff is always the worst route.  Sometimes it may be a better solution.  It is good that such remediation is held to a very high standard of proof.)

6. Landfill gas makes up a small percentage of “natural gas” emissions so while it should be used for energy production it is not a cure all.

TL;DR:  Composting or processing organic waste for agriculture is the way to go.  Burning methane and similar gas is better than not burning it.  If you can use it for power production that’s even better.  Burning other waste under the right conditions is **arguably** a valid path to reduce environmental impacts on a case by case basis."

Why don't people talk about using landfill waste as an energy source more often?,"I work in the industry. 

It is a big, growing topic among us in the industry. 

But there's something even better:

Not sending the waste to a landfill in the first place.

Look up Mixed Waste Processing (MWP).

I work for an MWP technology that can divert up to 90% of municipal solid waste from landfills and incinerators. Cities can send their garbage to us, and with our proprietary technology, we can cleanse/sanitize/hydrolyze it, sort it, and literally save up to 90% of it. We turn all the fiber into a food-grade fiber pulp; we capture the ferrous and non-ferrous metals; we capture and clean the plastics; we turn the food waste into biogas with an anaerobic digester; and last but not least, we create a refuse-derived fuel (RDF, aka SRF) from the less-than-ideal materials that are generated in our process, which can be used as fuel for all sorts of businesses.

Look up Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) which is the term used to describe the facilities where this process occurs. 

This stuff will change, and save, the world."

What would a truly sustainable future look like?,"To me that doesn't sound like a sustainable society. I'll offer you a more radical vision of what is needed to be sustainable....

Cities are retrofitted so that neighbourhoods become mini village centres. Everyone walks or bikes and there are very few cars. Intercity/regional electric trains are used for travelling longer distances. Everything is produced locally so there is no shipping industry or airline industry. Travel overseas involved wind powered ships.

Houses are now built to much higher standards so home heating is no longer needed. Building science is much more widely used now to achieve passive ventilation. This combined with shading with trees and abandoning places like Arizona has meant air conditioning is not needed in all but the hottest parts of the world. This has greatly reduced the need for electricity and this is able to be met mostly by hydro power and a little bit of solar. People have learnt to live with the flows of nature. People make sure they use electricity during the middle of the day and during some cloudy or non-windy stretches everybody limits their energy demand to only essential activities. This has greatly removed the need for battery technology. Wind turbines aren't really used after people realised there was no way around the huge amounts of concrete and steel needed in their production and limited recyclability so the technology was abandoned.

People own and consume much less stuff. Many things like yard tools are shared in community libraries. More things are done manually or with simple technology. When machines are used they are modular and easily repairable. Many industries that used to exist don't exist or exist in much reduced forms. Industries associated with meeting key human needs like food, utilities, healthcare, education are where most people work. Because efficiency gains are more widely shared and not taken up by additional consumption, most people only work 2-4 days a week. This leaves much more times for artistic pursuits and people using this time for crafting most of what they need rather than purchasing them. People do earn less but it doesnt matter because they don't consume anywhere as much energy and materials as they used to.

After we stopped producing fossil fuel fertiliser we tried to generate ""green hydrogen"" but again realised the hugely energy intensive process just made no commercial sense. People went back to growing the organic way. At first there was some resistance but when people saw how the animals and bird and bugs returned they realised that the huge reduction in upfront costs for fertilisers weren't the only benefit. The health of the soil also started to rebuild and yields increased to even higher than the last days of fossil fuel fertilisers. The plants were healthier too. We still got droughts and storms but the plants were more resilient to these events and would bounce back quicker.

Everything was slower. We weren't quite as financially rich as we were before. But we started to reconnect with nature...and each other. Community was rediscovered. Families reconnected. The land was healed. We all had less but we discovered that we had never been richer...."

If we can change our textiles to biodegradable natural materials without requiring so much agriculture as to harm further the environment.  We have to do so much.. micro plastics , pfas chemicals, etc AND do this not just here but around the world ...

That is just shifting the responsibility to somebody else. As long as we live in a world where people litter, eat meat with every meal, live in massive single family homes with huge monoculture lawns, use single use plastics all day long, and more, that is not truly sustainable.

Also, we need to do more habitat restoration and halt the continued destruction of habitat. A sustainable planet is one where humans and nature  (animals) can coexist."
What would a truly sustainable future look like?,"Most of the technologies you want already exist, they're just not deployed everywhere.

Batteries - at grid scale, pump water uphill to a reservoir during the day when you can use solar power. At night, release the water and use it to run a turbine. Don't have water or a hill? Use compressed air. We're very good at air compressor technology.

At the household and business level, use saltwater batteries. There's nothing exotic in them and they literally can't catch fire. Their major drawback is that they're bulky.

The only place where lithium batteries are superior is in cars, phones, and other devices where weight and mobility are needed. We should work on battery technology there and also have a tight recycling program for lithium so we don't mine more than we absolutely have to.

Packaging-we didn't used to wrap everything in plastic, we can go back to glass, cardboard, paper and whatever else. Fun fact, did you know that cellophane is made from cellulose?

It's not a technology problem, it's a business problem. It's expensive and risky to change. I can't buy what businesses don't offer. And some of these would have to happen at an industry or government level like lithium recycling or subsidies for people to buy EVs since you point out they're more expensive than gas cars. Or in the energy grid, why would you build storage when you already have a natural gas plant that you spin up and down as needed and gas is still cheap?

It's not a technology problem. It's having the will to change."

Nations like Africa, Australia and South America all have easy access to the southern ocean routes so ships departing there with exports can pick up the wind and move Eastward, diverting up into the Indian, pacific, or Atlantic oceans as necessary to offload their cargoes.  Obviously solar powered fast rail will be required to connect endpoints but those technologies are ready to step in once we get over our obsession with the personal car and non-renewable highways."
Could the world switch to Solar Power as the only source?,"Capacity could be built and the power generated, the technical problems are transmission and storage.  The best places for production aren't where people live.  Addressing this would require massive investment.

If you reframe the question to ""could we eliminate our use of fossil fuels"" the answer is an unequivocal yes, but it will require a mix of solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear.  The only hurdles then are economic and social.  Those are harder to solve than mere technological ones.  

We are evolving in the right direction, but not fast enough to avoid significant climate change."
Could the world switch to Solar Power as the only source?,"Maybe. 

My state has gone from 1% renewable energy to 70% renewable in about 20 years. 

20% of our electricity comes from solar, and 50% comes from wind farms. 

We've had times when the rooftop solar around the state had to be turned off remotely because it was producing too much electricity for the grid to handle. We've had times when it's produced over 90% of our electricity demands.

Sure you have pockets of solar efficient regions between the equator and the poles, but think of the regions where they get minimal to no sun in the winter. It would be a nightmare to create the grid needed to feed countries like Iceland or regions like Scandinavia or Alaska with just solar. 

Which is why each country/region plays to their strengths. You'll see Iceland capture geothermal energy and Norway are experts in hydro. There is no ""one"" technology that will work. We need each renewable energy technology to work in tandem with the others"

Then imagine this tech was interconnected over the planet and you could have a 'sector' contract into its ball form to allow space travel ships in and out.

The country needs efficient, well constructed and defined tendering for projects. With clear rules, arbitration, transparent decisions. All this contributes making the tender attractive for many ""players"", increasing the competition.

You need a harbor that is able to handle wind farm projects and logistics.

You need contractors, suppliers, experts, etc. who have experience, are efficient, are in competition with each other, etc.

All this is only possible by investing today. Trying to Kickstart later may work, but you will miss on the opportunity to develop your industry, attract foreign money and boost your local economy.

Solar Farms Have a Superpower Beyond Clean Energy: providing habitats for pollinators like bees and butterflies,This is a great perspective. Solar farms get too much bad press for being supposedly“bad for the environment” because they use farmland. But in fact can be very beneficial. And people also don’t take into consideration how farming also has a huge environmental impact.
"As the deployment of solar energy ramps up throughout the United States, we should seize every opportunity to optimize the use of the land that will sustain this booming industry.","[Renewable energy siting](https://www.energy.gov/eere/siting-large-scale-renewable-energy-projects) can be a complex process in which both public and private entities weigh the costs and benefits of new renewable energy deployments in a particular location.

Solar energy concentrate project,"this is basically how concentrated solar thermal generator work. [https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/concentrating-solar-thermal-power-basics](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/concentrating-solar-thermal-power-basics)  
Normally they use reflector instead of fresnel lens.  
CSP system is not economically competitive until it reach around 100 mw level. Below that level photovoltaic have better efficiency. And it require much higher maintenance cost compare to regular solar panel.  
  
Of course there are hybrid system that takes the left over heat from photovoltaic to power a microturbine, this have higher energy efficiency per space, but high cost per kwh, only viable in satellite situation.

There are also concentrate solar voltaic, this have high efficiency per weight, since you can put multiphase panel to absorb different spectrum of light. But often require cooling to prevent the panel going above optimal temperature. This is only viable on project where space is constraint rather than cost.

Huge ideal area for solar energy,"What you are looking for is a utility scale solar project developer. 

When you say ideal, what factors are you looking at? I think developers will look for land that is going to be near areas of large load, good point of interconnection, land that will be easy to permit for solar and a utility customer that would be interested in buying the energy. If you can show those things, you can probably work with any other utility developers that have shown interest in your state."

Question for solar energy users!,"I have a growatt system with a  6.5Kwh battery, right now if there is more than about 10kwh of solar through the day it will charge fully and be at about 20% by the time the sun comes up the following morning. With it being October and Scotland that doesn't always happen so often it will reach its switch off 10% charge sometime through the night, but its still better to store and use the power than just export it at 3p per kwh."
Question for solar energy users!,"I have panels and a powerwall.  I run the house off of the powerwall every night during the peak energy charges, then switch back to the grid once rates drop to normal.

i could run the house off of the powerwall all night, but fiscally that doesn't make as much sense as using it to avoid premium rate charges."
Question for solar energy users!,"Generally, for a grid tied system, batteries just don't make economic sense.

For my system, I go from \~80-85% self sufficiency to \~95% by adding a battery. The cost of batteries is quite high, with a shorter lifespan than solar panels and correspondingly less ""bang for the buck.""

Personally, I have a 26KWh battery that we leave at least 15% charged. I have a high baseload and it will power my house through the night (in an emergency, it takes 2 minutes to unplug enough non-mission critical things to drop my baseload in half). As long as the panels aren't covered in snow and there is not thick cloud cover, the battery will charge. 

I have a battery for utility out situations. Without it, the solar must disconnect when the grid is unavailable. I also have a whole house generator for back up in extended weather disasters. Having both doesn't make economic sense unless you are looking for redundant back up.

But yes, people are using solar powered batteries, but there is usually more to it than simple economics."
Question for solar energy users!,"I do solar installations for a living in South Africa, where we have loadshedding. (google it if you don't know)

In the wonderful times where we don't have any scheduled blackouts, which are few, we set our customers systems to use battery power until the batteries reach 20 or 30% before pulling in grid power. All our customers have noted a significant reduction in electricity costs when run this way.

However, when we have blackouts on the way, we set the systems to use grid power first, keeping the batteries full for when they're needed."
Question for solar energy users!,"I have enough battery power for a few rainy days without any sunshine. On my personal experience in the industry, I'd actually say the vast majority of people do not have battery backup. They offset their usage during the day and sell back to the utility at a rate less then what they pay per kw/h.

&#x200B;

edit sidenote: Tesla Powerwall for battery backup is probably the most popular and can be combined with a Tesla vehicle to extend the battery capacity of a house. Tesla actually gives you a lot of control. In the case of a power outage, if a car charger has power you can go fill up the car, then come home and charge the house from the car."
Question for solar energy users!,[deleted]
Question for solar energy users!,Most who have on grid setups with 1:1 full net metering without TOU rates have no need to live off batteries.  Others in say California with high TOU rate differences in rates are much more likely to use them in the way you discuss. Also off grid settings.
Question for solar energy users!,"The cost to buy and install large enough batteries to really make a decent sized home self-sufficient through the night and until the sun comes up the next day is pretty high (like $30,000 if you are buying something like a Tesla Powerwall), so very few people do it. But it is certainly doable."
Question for solar energy users!,"Yes, for 4 years."
Question for solar energy users!,"Budget for $30k-$50k. It's possible but not widely done because of the expense. If you're going to spend that much, why nighttime only? Real ""preppers"" go totally off grid and have very modest electrical needs.

It makes no economic sense for saving money on off-peak rates. If you get a 10¢/kWh saving, and use only 20 kWh at night, you save $2 per day, $730 per year. A 41 year payoff for a $30k system."

Ethanol is a comically inefficient form of solar energy—and a toxic one. Putting regular solar panels on some of that land would be better.,"Growing corn to make ethanol is one of the stupidest things that can be done with land.  Especially now that EVs are commonplace.

1 acre = 4,046m\^2.  At 22% efficiency, that is  890 KW of solar.   At 20% capacity factor that will make 1560 MWh/ year.

A Model 3 uses  198 Wh/km.   1560 MWh/198Wh/km = 7.88 million Kms.   Lets see you beat that growing corn to make ethanol to burn in an ICE vehicle.

Apparently 1 bushel of corn yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol.   If the corn yield is 200 bushels per acre that land would make enough corn for 560 gallons of ethanol.  If a car got 30 MPG that would be 16,800 miles or 27,050 km.

So... 7.88 million Kms versus 27,050 Kms.   291x further.  And this doesn't include the petroleum used by the farmer or the chemicals and fertilizer used to raise the corn.

Incredibly stupid."

Is it worth purchasing the extended service plan from my solar energy installer?,The items not covered by them under standard plan is a bit saddening to me.
Is it worth purchasing the extended service plan from my solar energy installer?,I would make sure it’s actually a rebate and not a tax credit I know a lot of reps will word things to make it sound like your getting a rebate when it’s a tax credit going towards your tax  liability. And any warranty is worth it. Better to be covered then having to wonder if you will have to save up for repairs or not. But you live at your home so you should be able to judge if a warranty is necessary
Looking to learn about solar energy,"For starters:

How old is the system?

Total amount of panels (in maximum kW-kilowatts- they can produce)

What size and type of inverter (in kW)

Battery size - in kWh (kilowatts per hour)

Is there a backup generator?

  
Also, check back on your own electricity bills and have a reasonable idea of how much electricity you use per day (average is OK) with your current house/appliances. Compare with the appliances you'll be running in the new house for a really, really rough estimate of what you'll need, or, on the other hand, what you *won't* be able to power.

Recent systems should have webpages/apps that the seller could provide data from (daily/monthly/annual/by season). That would be useful, as it would be specific to what they are running, and that particular system.

""Off-grid"" can mean anything from an ancient system that requires heaps of maintenance, and powers a small fridge and a few lights... to a modern system that will be little different than being plugged into the grid."

"Do the photons we reflect back to the sun affect said sun in anyway?

"Do the photons we reflect back to the sun affect said sun in anyway? Also, why aren't the solar panels black, I thought black absorbed the most energy?","1) No, that fraction of the photons hitting the earth and reflecting back would be infinitesimal.

2) The energy bearing wavelengths absorbed are not affected by the colour of the panels. 

2a You *can* buy black panels*.* Some manufacturers offer them  basically for cosmetic reasons.

2b Black items tend to absorb heat energy, ie infra red spectrum

2c At some point some clever person *will*  market a combined PV and hot water panel but will be doomed commercially to a tiny niche. It would require both plumbing and electrical connection making installation, maintenance & repair costs out of practical range."

I need help to maximise autoconsuption of solar energy,"that is very interesting project. I am looking into something like that, only my system is lot smaller. 

Is there is some kind of sensor/meter that can measure solar radiance and then turn on a relay that can control an appliance like a water heater? My growatt SPF 5000 Inverter seem not to have that option, it simply float charges the battery with a small current/wattage and unless you put the load on it you do not know how much energy it receives from the solar array. 

I have an off grid system and i do not wish to use the energy from the battery banks for big appliances like water heater, I rather use the energy from solar array when there is enough of it to run the water heater.  



Here is an example how I think that solution should work;  if my solar array produces over 1.4KW at any given time then solar relay/sensor will turn on the water heater that uses 1.2KW. That way solar panel array produces enough energy to run the water heater without taking some of the power from the  battery array. Consequently,  if current solar array output drops below 1.4KW then solar sensor/relay turns off the heater until solar conditions improve enough so that water heater can run purely of the solar array. 

if anyone has any suggestions it will be very appreciated"

Bf is interested in working with solar energy,"I’m an engineer, worked for 20 years in manufacturing before I moved into solar.  I started off as a designer, then sales now sales manager.  Even with an engineering degree, I went back to school (community college) to get a clean energy technology AAAS. I look for sales people who are technically minded, and hopefully know something about solar - although we will train if you don’t. But if you come to me with some training, I’m more likely to put you on the top of the list. I’d suggest your BF get some training under his belt now, while job searching.  Lots of resources out there - community colleges like I did, online at NABCEP are good places to start. It generally takes at least a year of design training and working on the phones before we let you out to sell.  

All this said, I work for a very ethical Solar company- and did that on purpose - I had to wait a bit until a job opened at a company I liked.  Definitely scope out the companies in your area, find a local installer that’s been around a few years and try to get in there.

Costco Solar Energy program,"Hello we are Erron and Lora De La Torre.  We are reaching out to you today because we have been a victim of Costco and their affiliate program with Sunrun Solar.  Three years ago we decided to get solar panels and batteries through Costco via Sunrun.  We thought going through Costcos for this solar project, we would receive the same customer service and quality as in the warehouse stores. In the past we also bought our automobiles through the Costco car buying program and even though you are dealing with a private dealership. The dealership shows you the Costco special pricing list and gives the highest quality customer service. But Sunrun is the opposite... at the Costco warehouse you set up an appointment. Salesperson comes out to explain what is the best option for your home. I trust Costco so I went with Sunrun recommended, now two years later Sunrun comes out to install the solar project. You might be wondering what happened in those two years. Well there were a lot of phone calls to Sunrun and Costco. I went through 4 project managers. Resigned my loan documents three times, because the loan documents expire if the solar project is not installed within a certain time frame. At Costco it’s very hard to speak to anyone in the home installation department.   After the project was installed, the installers explained to us our system has permission to operate (connect to the grid) from Edison and have us sign documents on the installers iphone. This gives the ok to start financing, but we did not have permission to operate. Our home was not ready for permission to operate until 9 months later. During those 9 months we were making payments on the solar loan, but had no permission to operate from Edison. Sunrun did pay us back that part of the loan, a very small amount. Now we have a $2500 plus and of the year electric bill, when Sunrun told us you will be just paying the loan back that there will be no bill from Edison, you will be getting money back from them.  I call Sunrun and Sunrun really doesn’t want to be accountable for the high electric bill. Our home is only 1200 square feet and it’s only us two that live at our address. No electric cars. So finally I got a hold of Costco in the home installation department. And Costco said everything looks good to them.  Now because Sunrun does not want to be accountable for the salesperson,s mistake designing our solar system and misleading us. If you look at the attachments you can see month to month of our electric bill. The first month was over $800. To me it looks like the 2 Tesla batteries are costing us more money to charge them than what our house is using. With the cost of solar system loan and the year end electric bill. Now we are paying about 2.5 times for electricity. We are willing to help any news network to help other consumers to not go through Costco in home installation or Sunrun especially when Costco can’t do anything if you’re ripped off by their home installation partners. Technically you are buying the solar equipment from Costco, but you are not. Costco does not have anything to do with in-home installation partners. It seems that in-home installation partners are paying Costco to sell their equipment and services. If this is the case, Costco should be transparent with this information. Any more information any news media needs, we are willing to give.  We thank you for your time in reading this, we just really do not want any other home owners to be taken advantage of by Costco and Sunrun and their predatory practices. Costco will return a vacuum 3 years after purchase, but they will ignore their members when it comes to standing between them and a paycheck from an affiliate.

Costco Solar Energy program,"JA panels are a top tier panel while being lower cost. Sunrun uses these panels because of warranty and guarantees and pricing JA gives Sunrun. JA is offered to all dealers using Sunrun financing as well. There are better panels yes but not by much. When solar was starting to gain steam 2010 it was important to go with a large company. But now even small companies have the same technology, warranties, and equipment. Just like with any other trades/ contracting business it its important to get multiple quotes ask many questions and research.  Good luck."
Costco Solar Energy program,It is Sunrun that does Costco’s solar. Since you are getting batteries I do recommend that you go with the PPA over a straight purchase. Batteries only have a 10 year manufacturer warranty and are built to cycle out and they are expensive. Going with the PPA Sunrun offers they will replace the battery for the length of the contract. This alone could be worth 60 to 100k depending on the number and type of batteries you use. I am going to DM you.
What happens if you’re not on a solar specific energy plan with your energy company?,"1. What’s the utility? Sounds like a Texas TDU. 

2. Does he have monitoring? Should be able to see production at the least, consumption and production at best.

3. Does he have kWh History data before going solar? 

Most likely the panels are working, reducing his needs to buy power during the day. And excess solar is being fed to the retail supplier for their 100% profit."
What happens if you’re not on a solar specific energy plan with your energy company?,"Someone needs to correct this with the utility.  Talk to your installer.  They should be responsible for it.  Problem is if the meter is not even swapped, they will not be able to get accurate data"

I realize the same current needs to move through each module in a string and if a particular module can't output similar levels as the others in the string, some current may be dissipated through that module in the form of heat (and can even burn holes in the backsheet in the case of shaded or broken cells).  Though, I'm still not confident these things are the rationale behind the optimizers.

(Ultimately, I'm concerned this installer is going to try putting modules on other parts of my roof that aren't remotely south facing, and that he's trying to reduce the losses that result from some modules on a string facing in vastly different directions than others on the same string.)"

Assessing the viability of a Solar System for my energy needs,"From your responses solar isn't for you. 
To get the best out of it needs research and monitoring. 

You'll need to monitor usage and decide on batteries and look at swapping tariffs. 

It can pay back very well for you or you might just waste your money. 

You're a grown up now. You need to do nerdy stuff with houses."
Assessing the viability of a Solar System for my energy needs,"First things first: kW and kWh are not the same thing. You use 200kWh of energy per month, this systems power output is 2kW. See the difference?

1kW typically puts out 1200-1500kWh per year. 

So: you use 12x200 = 2400kWh. 

2kW x 1200 = 2400kWh."
Assessing the viability of a Solar System for my energy needs,The easiest way is honestly doing community solar you still get the savings without having to install solar in your property.

My thoughts on Nuclear.,"I understand your concerns about the safety of nuclear power and they are legitimate concerns, but you are completely ignoring the advantages. Nuclear power is the only form of ""cleaner"" energy that can realistically compete with coal power plants and other similar fossil fuel power sources. The design failures you mentioned are extremely rare and because of the amount of danger that a malfunction poses, more failsafes and precautions are put in place on nuclear reactors than anything else in the world. The biggest problem with nuclear power is what to do with the waste that it generates, we need a better solution than bury it. Nuclear power has its problems but the benefits outweigh the negatives."
My thoughts on Nuclear.,"There is no solution without nuclear Energy at the moment,
we will see a massive Explosion in the World-Population and this People must get Energy because Progress is the only Way to stop overpopulation.

There is no Progress without Energy.

Also look for the environmental Damage of the Inga Dam,
as well as all the Hydro-Power Stations in northern India (& etc.)

Look for the Airpollution in China, look for Oilsand in Canada, Fracking in the USA, the ""War for Oil"", etc.!

Of course, there is no 100% Security but this is a ""normal Problem"" and we face it every single Day, 24/7/365.

My thoughts on Nuclear.,[deleted]
My thoughts on Nuclear.,"looks like your points already have opposing and well structred arguments, i havent done enough research to add more arguments but i just wanted to say this: when you read about plane crashing disasters killing hundreds and whatnot, doesn't it feel like travelling by plane is the worst evil of all? [after all these horrible accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft), wouldn't one think that planes kill more on average and would rather stick to, say cars? however this is not the case, according to NSC, [you're more likely to die of a car crash than of an aircraft related incident](http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx), but if cars kill more why isnt that emphasized on? because plane crashes are so rare that once they happen, the media just cant get enough of blabbering about it, but the many car crashes per day that kill around 10~ on average? meh. 

this bias is more or less the same thing with nuclear energy and its competitors:coal and petrol based electricity. reactor meltdowns are big news and stay on the headlines for even weeks when they do happen, but in everyday life? you're more likely to get asthma or other breathing diseases from the toxic emissions of gasoline based cars and coal burning etc(they say it causes cancer too but i'm not sure about that one) than to be killed by the radiation of a reactor that has failed. supporting the nuclear energy industry and not bashing it like witchcraft would lead to improved designs that are more efficient, produce less waste, and you know, less likely to go kaboom(by the way, it's worth noting that in the case of fukushima, the failure was directly linked to the tsunami that hit the area, the plants that were way above sea level didnt fail IIRC, but i'm not sure about this one either, excuse my lack of research). hell we already have designs that aim to get rid of the waste that comes from other reactors too (the waste is mostly Uranium-238 that doesn't seem to fission nearly as well as the initial Uranium-235, which is why it couldnt be used in conventional reactors) like breeder reactors. 

sure, solar and wind leave no waste whatsoever, but generating electricity from them requires specific weather conditions that cannot always be guaranteed, and storage is a bit of an issue too as conventional battery designs still can't deal with storing so much electricity that can power an entire city, fission fuel can be stored for on demand use and doesn't need to wait for the sun to shine and the air density/ambient temperature to be just right etc.., it can also be used in applications where solar/wind is just not an option(like nuclear submarines)."

How could we better educate people?","Solar and wind strike an emotional chord and seem more logical at face value if you don’t know any science. People don’t know what nuclear power is or why it does what it does, so it’s a scary unknown. People also only remember the Chernobyls because the countless non-eventful operating hours of many plant sites are less interesting and not in the news. Disperse pollution and general lack of efficiency generally aren’t interesting topics to the public and therefore the most negatives to solar/wind/etc. are completely missed. 

It always kills me when people say ‘but with more research we will be able to store solar power!’ Dump that cash into nuclear energy research instead where it can have a larger impact. 

TLDR; nuclear is not intuitive and can have large accidents = scary to the public despite any positives (no one cares, really, until THEIR power is out)

This is why I don't think using deaths per unit power is a good metric to argue for nuclear with.,"I'm confused, why don't you think it's a good idea? Was that sarcastic, or was the picture supposed to be self explanatory?"
This is why I don't think using deaths per unit power is a good metric to argue for nuclear with.,"There's lies and then there's statistics.

By ""deaths from Fukushima"", they have actually including the 573 evacuation related deaths. Personally, I lean on the side that including deaths due to what boiled down to an unnecessary evacuation is incredibly misleading. I can see reason for including it, but, hey, that's statistics for you.

This is without considering the incredibly difficult to calculate ""excess cancer deaths"" due to events like Fukushima and Chernobyl. These figures are always estimated to be way lower than background variations of cancer, to the point where the figures are so statistically insignificant that they become irrelevant.

Not to mention the even less calculable figure of ""deaths saved"" when polluting energy sources are replaced by non-polluting/lower polluting energy sources. Its impossible to calculate exactly how many lives have been saved by a reduction in global warming.

My point is the figures here could easily be a function of their methodology, so you should rely more on the order of magnitude difference. In other words wind/solar/nuclear/hydro are safe, probably to the same degree, and we should be investing in all of these energy success.

Not to mention, that all these figures are nothing compared to excess deaths the planet is seeing each day right now from Covid. Yes, energy generation is a choice, covid isn't. But 573 (Fukushima), 31-8000 (Chernobyl, from memory) vs 2,060,000 (first figure I saw on Google) as of today for Covid gives you some perspective.

The merits of nuclear vs the other low carbon sources are not to do with deaths - they are to do with energy security, a more reliable baseload supply, controlled waste products, and a reduced impact on the physical landscape."

Any thoughts about this 60 minutes Australia video visiting fukushima and the broader discussion about nuclear power?,"It’s nice that discussions like this arise because nuclear power is absolutely fantastic. They mentioned Australia has plenty of Uranium deposits, but I believe it also has a ton of Thorium as well. Thorium is even safer than Uranium as a fuel if I recall correctly! 

Disasters like Fukushima, Chernobyl, 3-mile Island, etc. are tragic and terrifying and the news takes advantage of that. It scares people away from an incredible energy source. We should be thinking of this like an airline accident. The safest airline to ride with after an accident is the one that had said accident. They will without hesitation correct and improve their safety. Nuclear power was extremely safe even when Chernobyl happened. We’ve had time to improve and develop technologies further. Like the closing quote in the video, everyone should be considering nuclear power as an energy source; with or without coal based power."
"With Pollution On The Rise, Will Europe Resist Germany's Dirty War On Nuclear Power?","The current nuclear options leave indeed little waste, but our generation leaves it up to countless future generations to deal with its radioactivity for thousandths of years. 
Not that all nuclear energy is bad: fusion sounds good, but might be many years away before it is feasible. 
Thorium reactors might do the job too. But please stop with that current fission filth; in the name of generations to come."
Question about the costs of nuclear energy,"Unfortunately, energy markets are complex and the most immediate conclusions made by the layperson are generally wrong. I've previously worked as an energy analyst and my background is engineering.

>LCOE

LCOE is the cost the generator must sell electricity at to break even. It is a figure that varies from its many inputs, will vary region to region and is aimed at investors and businesses. Hence, it almost always includes subsidies which in this case means lots of subsidies for renewables and very few for nuclear.

On top of this, as it's simply a figure of how much a generators must earn to break even, it does not include external costs (i.e. a major component of end-user costs). In the case of variable renewables this means storage and/or backup. These costs are not immediately visible, but when these subsidies and external costs are included, the cost for a nuclear power grid is actually cheaper than a renewable grid in most cases. This was explored in the peer reviewed MIT report [The Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World](http://energy.mit.edu/research/future-nuclear-energy-carbon-constrained-world/). 

The short version: backup sufficient to meet grid reliability standards is very expensive and even using outrageous western nuclear power costs, nuclear is still cheaper than that.

>Second argument

His argument is nonsense sprinkled in with some reality.

Yes, running nuclear power plants intermittently as variable renewable output goes up and down would would be stupid and expensive... But if you have enough nuclear capacity to back up your wind production, why the fuck would you build renewables? What point would be served when you already have a low CO2 source of power?

His entire argument is that renewables *must* be built, come hell or high water, and that everything else must be built around them. That position is facetious at best."
Question about the costs of nuclear energy,"Here is a simple question that exposes the issues; What is the cost of 1 MW of power on a cold still January midnight in Anchorage, Alaska?  And to further drive the nail in the coffin, what is the cost after a week of no wind days?"
Question about the costs of nuclear energy,"A lot to unwrap here.

First and foremost it must be understood that LCOE not a measurement of utility, it is loved by those that support renewables because it does not take into account the ancillary cost of variable renewable energy (VRE) which include the need for backup, most often in the form of natural gas generation.

LCOE also does not address the issue of the amount of energy any given installation can produce. A low cost per MW hr  is somewhat meaningless if the quantity being produced does not meet needs.

You are right, it would be ludicrous to build nuclear plants to support VRE - however the solution to that is not build VRE at all. What would be the point if nuclear plants could provide a constant and reliable source of electricity?

Cost effective energy storage is nowhere near as close as many make it out to be. Yes the cost of Li technology has dropped to nearly tenfold to US$156/kWh from what it started as, but that fact in and of itself is no guarantee it will fall to the US$20/kWh it needs to be. This is particularly a concern if  pressure starts to build on the raw material inputs. Furthermore as it relates to decarbonizing the transportation sector, the maximum theoretical potential of advanced lithium-ion batteries is still only about 6 percent of crude oil.

But what of other technologies that show up in the press time to time, surely one of them will be better? No. First there is no guarantee any of these will scale.  One can, however, use thermodynamics to calculate the upper limits of what’s possible for electrochemical based storage and when we do this, it becomes clear that these technologies will never compete with combustion of liquid fuels on energy density.

Energy density is also the major difficulty with hydrogen and while processes exist to use it and captured CO2 to make synfuels, this itself is very lossy and cannot be done effectively with VRE only energy inputs."
Got banned from r/renewable energy for stating facts about nuclear energy,"Yup.  I've run into this too on many forums.  People in oil, solar and wind will spread FUD about nuclear as much as possible to protect their investment.  Unfortunately governments have been bought to perpetuate this.  When you try to bring up facts on why solar and wind will not save the day you just get ostracized.

I am hoping Andrew can help to change the tide as I am only seeing him and Booker as the only candidates with a sensible path forward on addressing climate change.

The other candidates are not open to nuclear energy which will lead us down a worse off path.  I have an engineering background and if you do the math and MATH then we cannot leave nuclear energy off the table."
Got banned from r/renewable energy for stating facts about nuclear energy,What did you post?
Got banned from r/renewable energy for stating facts about nuclear energy,"Honestly I’m not surprised. For some reason green energy advocates seem to neglect facts and reality. They live in this utopian fantasy world where they can make everything green at the snap of their fingers (As long as it isn’t Nuclear). I worked at a Nuclear plant as an Engineer and I’ve gotten some pushback from friends on the facts I present on how valuable Nuclear is in the diversification of power generation
In the U.S. and the world. I am also curious what you said to get banned, but I imagine it was a factual statement that they flipped out about."
Got banned from r/renewable energy for stating facts about nuclear energy,"You can't talk sensible about this subject, they have so much to lose if the people catch on to their ruse. Algore says, there's a boatload of cash to be had. Don't ya know?"

> This week Le Monde reported that the government asked EDF, the country&#039;s main state-controlled energy company, to work up plans to build three new nuclear plants, each with a pair of its EPR reactors.

> French nuclear regulators pushed for safety upgrades to existing plants, and in 2015 the government voted to cut the share of nuclear in the nation&#039;s energy supply to 50% by 2025.In recent years, the nuclear industry has struggled in general amid safety concerns, rising competition from natural gas and renewables, and high-profile development boondoggles.

> So building six reactors wouldn&#039;t necessarily increase the share of electricity produced by nuclear plants across the nation, particularly as demand increases in the coming years.

> Tesla, which absorbed Solar City last year, has come out in favor of closing Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, California&#039;s largest source of clean energy.

> Imagine the outcry if a nuclear energy company tried not just to kill solar subsidies but actually remove Solar City panels from rooftops in order to build more nuclear plants.

> In Tesla&#039;s comments to the California Public Utilities Commission, Tesla makes a transparently self-serving argument in favor of closing Diablo Canyon: it can be replaced by solar panels and batteries.
