Wind energy penalty? Fluid dynamics?,"I’d say you need to do a better literature study, because I’m pretty sure the effects of wind farms on the atmosphere and meteorology have been researched by other groups."
Wind energy penalty? Fluid dynamics?,I say do the calculations and publish. If you really cant find any literature on the topic it is likely worth pursuing.
Wind energy penalty? Fluid dynamics?,"Maybe r/meteorology/ is a better place to ask?   

>thermal stratification and thermal pocketing in closed systems      

Doesn't that only happen when the fluid is (almost) stationary?  And what are the chances a wind turbine is even moving under those circumstances?     
Or, when the wind turbines are happily spinning along in Bft 9 winds, what are the chances that the lower atmosphere is not a little bit chaotic?"
Wind energy penalty? Fluid dynamics?,"It is true that if you had enough windmills you’d eventually make a negative feedback loop, however from what I’ve seen the numbers needed our vastly outside of what we currently even are capable of producing let alone have. And the jet stream getting broke up actually has a simpler solution, as warmer air than normal (because global warming) moves to colder regions (because thermodynamics, it pushes the cold air hard enough to break the usual cycle. This was a prediction made by climate scientists decades ago and like the majority of there studies have come to be true. Our weather is becoming more unbalanced, but we knew this was gonna happen, these ice storms aren’t a surprise and nether is the drought half the country will be in this summer"
Is there a wind energy for dummies video or site?,Also curious if such a resource exists.
One general questions regarding wind energy.,"The environmental impact of wind turbines is dwarfed by the impact of fossil fuel extraction, and burning of fossil fuels; birds are killed by buildings in one day than wind turbines kill in a year."
How do wind turbines store energy in the real world - not theoretical.,"They don't store energy.

However they can be regulated down if there is too much wind in an area to match demand."
How do wind turbines store energy in the real world - not theoretical.,"Electricity companies can store energy. There are different methods, but I don't know if they are very efficient. For example, they can raise water in a lake, compress air, use batteries, etc..."
How do wind turbines store energy in the real world - not theoretical.,"I work on wind farms—you have to build an additional storage facility for energy storage. If the grid doesn’t need the power we’re producing at any given moment, we get curtailed and have to shut off the turbines. It’s a huge bummer and it also means that there have to be a lot of backup generators as spinning reserve even when the wind farm is producing power because it’s power is highly variable. 

The storage thing is actually a huge issue for wind power companies. If you know anything about large scale battery storage, you might want to dust off your CV. I know a lot of wind companies who are paying B I G money for battery engineers right now."
How do wind turbines store energy in the real world - not theoretical.,"Generally no turbines do not store electricity, while battery storage and other storage methods can be used it is not common. Electricity generated is fed to the grid directly, and usually gets priority ahead of any fossil fuel made electricity. Electricity trading here anyway is done 24hrs in advance, where the expected demand is forcasted and then filled by a mix of renewables and not. If for some reason on the day the deman is different to the forcast, there is too much wind and they cant turn off the non renewables quickly, wind farms are instructed to limit their exports to a certain amount. So some or all of a farm will be turned off."
How do wind turbines store energy in the real world - not theoretical.," You can not store the energy a modern wind turbine is producing. It is to much, for this, you need large scale storage, like a pumped storage power plant.

Here is, what some companies are doing:
I have developing offshore wind power plants. We have installed batteries in our offshore turbines, so you can control them in case of a power grid loss during a storm. If you are not able to rotate the turbine in the correct angle into the wind, the turbine can be damaged, even destroyed."
How do wind turbines store energy in the real world - not theoretical.,Your correct on both accounts. Some windfarms are built with storage and some are not.
Educational Wind Energy project,"Hi! I love the idea! My daughter is only 2-month old, but I would like to do something similar when she's old enough.

I've worked in R&D for the wind energy for about 10y and last year, I created my company to produce small wind turbines. So I know a bit about the technics.

I love the idea of including everything around the turbine (trafo, data logging, etc). If you add a small test bench and ""lab"" validation, you have the full spectrum.

Floating offshore wind energy - Will it scale or is it just another renewables fad?,"The first solid foundation offshore wind turbines have been around for well over 10 years now. Floating is relatively new to the game. With such pioneering engineering challenges, flaws will have to become clear from the initial designs over the course of the years.

A lot of solid foundation offshore wind turbines have been installed now, and it's considered as quite standard. My guess is that it will scale up but it will take some time. Concession areas have to be defined (the easy ones are taken in most cases), projects have to be awarded, contractors have to be selected, designs must be made, all assets have to be built and installed. Such projects take years from concession areas being awarded to a wind farm being finished. 

Tldr: Yes, but it takes time."
Floating offshore wind energy - Will it scale or is it just another renewables fad?,"Floating offshore wind energy occupies a unique space in renewable energy. While it offers access to abundant offshore winds and minimal seabed disruption, its costs, efficiency, and interconnection challenges pose real hurdles. Whether it scales or remains a niche depends on innovation, cost reduction, and addressing these complexities."
Floating offshore wind energy - Will it scale or is it just another renewables fad?,"It offers so many advantages. There's no question. You can build it and tow it to its location, you can use deeper waters, there's no question it will stay."
Floating offshore wind energy - Will it scale or is it just another renewables fad?,"Yes it will scale. Two very simple reasons:

Assembly can be done at the shore and then the turbine is shipped out,meaning it can be ""cheap"".

It can access areas that can't be accessed otherwise and the demand for renewable electricity is only going to rise for the next 30 years."

Disadvantage of wind energy,"In theory, a huge wind farm could lead to this.

In practice, because we are not in a vacuum, what happens is that the wind speed after a wind turbine is lower than before (about 33% lower, afaik).

However, it creates a gradient of wind speed: above and on the sides if the turbine, the wind is not influenced. So if you go 3x the rotor size downwind, the impact is again negligible.

This is actually a key driver to define the side between wind turbines."
Disadvantage of wind energy,"I know this is an old question but I thought I'd chime in:  


Theoretically, yes, but practically, no. Flows redevelop after a certain distance, proportional to the rotor size. This is why when you see a wind farm you will see multiple rows of turbines quite a distance from consequent rows, because there is only so tall our turbines go but the wind profile is technically a lot taller, and the low pressure region created behind the wind turbine would encourage wind from above turbine height to redevelop the flow. Immediately after the turbine, this  would cause turbulence, but given that wind viscosity is low enough at turbine operation speeds, this redevelopment happens within, I believe 3 lengths? So let's say the turbine diameter is 200m, the wind would redevelop to laminar flow within 600m.

&#x200B;

This and the fact that the actual size of the windfront is humongous compared to any wind farm we can actually set up, and you'll see why this won't have that much of an impact. Will it reduce the wind's energy? Of course it will, that's its purpose. Will it have a substantial impact? Hardly. 

&#x200B;

Winds are powered by two main factors: differential heating rates across the earth's surface, and the rotation of the earth. The rotation can be considered near constant because the slowing rate is very negligible. And the sun provides as much energy to the earth in a day via solar radiation as the entire human population consumes in 1 year. This is a tremendous amount of energy driving our winds, and we are able to extract a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny amount of this energy even with all the plants we have set up. So, no, large wind farms (at least as large as they get right now) don't affect the cooling capacity.

&#x200B;

If we were to take an even more long term approach: the advent of larger wind farms would only be possible with increased emphasis on renewable energy, which would reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. This would reduce our carbon emissions and over years slow down the heating rate of the planet, requiring lesser cooling capacity of incoming winds, even if said wind farms do detract the cooling capacity."
MSc Sustainable energy or MSc Wind Energy?,"Hi! 

I started the Sustainable study line a few years back, but moved over to the Wind Energy study line after the first semester.
I felt like the choice of courses for that one was more interesting and technical (which I like), but I also realised that I really like electrical engineering and saw that I could focus more on that and power systems in the Wind Energy line.

I have a background in physics, so had not really been exposed to power system engineering before in my studies, but it really got me interested in that Power System Fundamentals course (or what it was called).

So I think it depends a bit on what you’re interested in and what kind of career you’re looking for :)"

Storing wind energy,I’ve looked into this and made a preliminary design that incorporated reduction gears to get the torques and speeds right. When all was said in done it was much more complex than a simple battery system. Maybe I over thought it but there is a reason battery’s are the most utilized method of energy storage. If you want to look into modern methods of mechanical energy storage check out flywheel systems.

The UK government pledged £160m to offshore wind earlier this week.

The UK government pledged £160m to offshore wind earlier this week. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the UK's energy plans following Boris Johnson's announcement.,"As much as I would like to agree with the previos comment, offshore wind still isn’t mature enough to stand on its own feet and start rejecting fiscal incentives and subsidies from the government. Given UK’s clear lead in this industry, it is the only country (except for maybe China & Germany) who can work on tackling more advanced challenges facing the industry - including bringing down the costs (yes, they’re still not competitive enough), operation & maintenance, decommissioning and recycling of the end-of-life plants (something only UK & Germany can do at this point). 

Not to forget the up-and-coming role of floating wind and deepwater wind technologies - both of which are currently in very nascent stages, and are right profiting from the immense support that UK has so far given them. 

Finally, UK is an island located in the middle of very windy seas and very highly developed know-how of its surrounding oceans. Not to forget, one on the verge of Brexit. It’ll need all the help it can get, especially in a sector as crucial as energy security gets. I think the govt is smart to keep funding this swift momentum."

"Can window, solar and hydro power really power a whole country?","Of course it is, it's a matter of investment and government policies, so ultimately a matter of who you vote for in most places.

If you want 100% you'll need:

- end user storage, which you'll probably get if more people switch to electric cars with smart charging (two way charging). That means government incentive to buy electric cars or taxes on internal combustion engine.

- grid storage with second life used batteries and brand new batteries. Using full potential of hydro storage and developing new forms of storage.

- insulate people's home, especially in the poorest parts. So once again a matter of policies. Once you have a really well insulated home and it's heated with a heat pump the efficiency skyrockets and consumption comes down at the time the energy is most needed

- long distance energy trading. If it's windy in the UK and Sunny in Morocco or Italy, it doesn't matter if it rains in France as long as France can import. That requires a good relationship with your neighbors.

- use overproduction to generate hydrogen, either for long term storage or for heavy vehicles (boats, lorries etc)

All these solutions (bar R&D for new types of storage) are already available, and in some cases like sun and wind, cheaper than their existing alternatives. The rest needs injection of money to kick start the economy of scale."

Wind power and solar photovoltaics found to have higher energy returns than fossil fuels,"Damn, there goes another talking point..."
Wind power and solar photovoltaics found to have higher energy returns than fossil fuels,"""The problem
Extracting energy from the environment requires an energy investment, such as to extract and refine oil, or to manufacture a wind turbine. A widespread view is that renewable energy systems require the investment of much more energy per unit of energy delivered than fossil fuels, leading to a low energy return on investment (EROI) — the ratio of energy delivered to energy invested. The implications of this situation would be far-reaching, raising the question of whether it is possible to sustain an industrial society under a renewable energy system. Yet, it is noteworthy that this narrative has been questioned by studies adopting equivalent analysis boundaries for fossil fuels and renewable energy at the final-energy stage (that is, the energy carrier delivered to the end-user, such as electricity or gasoline)1.

Previous studies, however, omitted the fact that renewable energy systems such as wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) yield a high-quality energy carrier: electricity. Electricity end-uses often have higher efficiencies than those of fossil-fuel-based carriers. By including end-use efficiencies, we extend the boundary of analysis to determine the EROI at the useful energy stage, which is the energy available after conversion of a final energy carrier in an end-use device (for example, a car engine)."""
Wind power and solar photovoltaics found to have higher energy returns than fossil fuels,"...and if we also  include energy equired for cleanup of any waste....Oh boy.

Why this is omitted in every study - thereby *massively* skewing the calculations in favor of fossil fuels - is beyond me.

If it is just that eroi of renewables is greater than fossils, yeah that is cool but not specifically significant. For renewables all that matters is that it is significantly higher than 1 and that you are cleaning up the energy mix used to create more renewables. Higher EROI for renewables just allow you to run that virtuous circle much faster and reach decarbonization quicker because now not even the energy used to create new renewables is carbon intensive if you use renewable electricity to produce more renewable tech. For fossil, no matter how high the EROI you will never reach decarbonization. But better to read the article then pontificate on Reddit ;-)"

Next up, solar will beat coal. Then wind and solar combined will start to beat natural gas occasionally, then regularly. When Solar AND Wind are beating Natural Gas, that will be the tipping point for me. It may take another 20 years, but it is coming...

India has ramped up its wind and solar energy. It now needs to expand places to store it,"Are there ways to store energy as heat or cold?

Eons ago I worked for Motorola in Tempe, AZ, USA (doesn’t matter who or where, just for background, but somewhere that needed to create coldness) and the building created “ice” (I assume it was, literally, cold solid H2O, but I don’t know) at night when the building could buy electricity more cheaply than during the day (I think AZ had nuclear power, so the grid was always in need of customers for their electricity 24 hours a day). Then, during the day, basically fans blew air over the ice to cool condition the indoor airtemps. 

Any technology using the surplus excess solar during sunny days to store that electricity as a useable “cold”.

Conversely — until we tap into the heat coming from data centers and reuse that heat as a commodity in industry (industrial laundry, breweries, etc.) — I’d there a technology to store surplus excess solar during sunny days to store that electricity as a useable “heat” (on a utility scale, not just those rooftop domestic water tank heaters, if they are still a thing)

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"> Afaik solar and wind will require trillions of dollars invested to supply current demand.

So will any other source.

Total annual electricity consumption globally is about 24,000 TWh, which at normal wholesale electricity prices of $50 / MWh is $1.2 trillion a year spent on electricity.

Investing trillions to replace the generation capacity for a $1 trillion / year global market is completely to be expected.

At current prices, replacing the entire global energy supply with a 50/50 mix of solar and wind would cost approximately $11 trillion, for a generation capacity that will last 25 years with no fuel costs and not very high maintenance costs. Assuming life-time maintenance and operation costs equal to the initial investment, that would be an effective cost for global electricity of about $0.9 trillion per year. 

Completely competitive with current prices.

Numbers just sound big because the global energy / electricity market is very large. 

&#x200B;

On the other side of things, solar farms generally have an installed capacity of about 50 MW / km^(2), which will produce 65 GWh / year of electricity in an average location.  In good locations, such as south west north America, Australian deserts, North Africa, Arabian Desert, Gobi Desert in China / Mongolia, big chunks of Brazil, Chile, etc, generation is more like 90 GWh / year or more from this 1 km^(2) solar plant.

At 90 GWh / km^(2), we can cover the worlds electricity use with an area of about 270,000 km^(2). It sounds like a big number, and IS a big number, but remember we are talking globally here. Cover 1% of the Gobi Desert, Sahara desert, Arabian Desert, Australia, desert areas of South-West NA, Brazil + Chile, and you have the 270,000 km^(2) area without straying into lower generation areas.

There are also something like 200,000 km^(2) of rooftops in the world, which, while they will be somewhat lower generation, could supply a large chunk of the generation capacity without any additional land use impact.

Capacity density for wind turbines is actually lower than solar, about 5 MW / km^(2) because of required spacing of wind turbines. However, direct land use is lower: turbines need to be widely spaced, but the land between them can be used for other purposes like agriculture. Currently, direct land use works out to be about 0.003 km^(2) / MW for on-shore turbines. Also, the amount of energy generated per year by wind turbines for a given installed capacity is higher, working out to about 3 GWh / MW of capacity (compared to 1.4 - 1.8 more typical for solar). This all means that you get about 15 GWh / km^(2) of wind farm area covered, or 1000 GWh / km^(2) of direct land use.

That means that covering the worlds electricity use with wind would mean wind farms covering 1,600,000 km^(2), but only directly blocking 24,000 km^(2) of land use. Globally, this is large, but not unachievable. It's about 1% of the global land area of wind farms. We could do that by dropping wind turbines into just 3% of the worlds agricultural land, while actually only blocking 0.05% of that land from agricultural use.

It's probably also worth noting that something like 16% of the worlds electricity use currently comes from hydro, which is renewable. This is unlikely to increase much further, but it does in principle reduce the amount of solar/wind we need to build out.

&#x200B;

The one other wrinkle that comes up is that electricity currently isn't the dominant world *energy* use. Only something like 25% of the worlds current energy use is from electricity. So if we want to replace all *energy* use by renewables, and not just all *electricity* use, the problem is larger. However, the total *energy market* is also larger, so economically, the situation stays about the same. For instance, the world consumes about 100 million barrels of oil per day, almost all of which go to non-electricity energy (such as transportation in cars, and heating). At $60 / barrel, that is an extra $2.2 trillion a year we are spending on energy. Natural gas consumption is something like 4 trillion m^(3) per year, at normal (pre-COVID pre-Ukraine) prices of about $0.3 / m^(3), giving a global market of $1.2 trillion annually, only 1/3 of which is used for electricity (most of the rest used for heating). If you add these to current electricity costs, global energy market is more like $4 trillion a year.

Furthermore, if we electrify transport (electric vehicles instead of gas ones), energy consumption for transport will drop by at least a factor of two (EVs are much more efficient). That alone drops world energy use by something like 12%. Heating is an even bigger fraction of global energy use, at around 50%, most of which is by combustion currently. Replacing this heating with electric heat pumps can reduce this energy use by a factor of 2-3, amounting to a 20% reduction in total world energy usage.

Adding these two together, we get something like a 1/3 drop in total global energy use from electrification. That means that to replace all energy use by electricity, the target is something like 64,000 TWh / year of electricity. 

That scales the cost up to about $30 trillion for building out a 50/50 wind/solar renewable grid, and land uses for each half of that of 360,000 km^(2) for solar (direct land use), and 2,100,000 km^(2) (total area) or 32,000 km^(2) (direct land use) for the wind half.

Overall if you assume 25 year lifespan, and total lifetime maintenance + operation costs equal to the capital expense, it's something like $2.4 trillion / year energy cost for running the entire global energy market on solar + wind, compared to the current $4 trillion global energy market. To cover intermittency, you might want to bump the solar+wind generation up by 50% or so, which brings the cost to $3.6 trillion / year. Still less than current costs for energy. And the cost of both wind and solar has continued to come down in recent years.

&#x200B;

**In summary, it is both economically feasible and land-use feasible to cover all of the worlds energy use with a mixture of solar and wind at current project prices.**"
Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"Wind/Solar can provide most of the energy the world needs. The issue right now is investment, regulatory hurdles, and resource constraints. All of these things seem to be going in a mostly positive direction.

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"Read the IPCC report. 

Literally just read the latest IPCC report. It's all in there. (You did say the more detail, the better.) 

Or hit up one of many summaries available online, for example [CarbonBrief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-on-how-to-tackle-climate-change). (I have no idea if they're the best, but the name sticks.)

Here's a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/SarahLynnBurch/status/1511009927640371200) by someone who claims to be one of the lead authors on the IPCC report. 

For a very basic summary:

- We don't think we can completely stop all fossil fuel use by 2050 _while continuing economic growth_ and allowing increased standards of living in poorer countries - but it can be massively drawn down. Coal must stop and all other fossil fuel use must be abated with carbon capture.

- The vast majority of new primary energy production will come from solar and wind, but other renewables and nuclear power will also play a smaller role.

- Insulation, reduction of food waste, reduced need for transport, and other draw-downs of demand will offset part of the continued increase in electricity need. (Personal note: All these reductions in demand are incredible cost-savers, and that they're not already being done everywhere is a failure of our political and economic system.)

- Investments are high, but must increase approx. 300-600% to meet targets.

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"What’s the issue? Coal, gas etc all require both capital and large operational investments? You can google it, but wind and solar are consistently providing the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) over the life of the asset. You also need to remember that both oil and gas are volatile, and you run the risk of no supply or steep costs you cannot forecast. 

The way around this is that a lot of project developers are taking on the risk of financing and owning the assets and are selling the power on long term contracts to the utilities. People are investing because it’s cheaper than coal and still companies are making money. Brookfield Renewables is a $30bil company. There’s money to be made."

Can wind and solar realistically provide majority of the energy required globally? What are other major renewable alternatives?,"The short answer is yes. Wind and solar are abundant and cheap. In most parts of the world they are now the cheapest new build options to generate power. They don’t rely on finite fossil fuel inputs and are not subject to geopolitically sensitive fuel supplies and prices. Their primary energy inputs are practically infinite. They don’t produce greenhouse gas emissions or local air pollution. There are other renewable alternatives too. Hydro power is one, but in most parts of the world the potential for hydro power has been exhausted. Tidal power is another, but so far nobody has figured out how to scale it and make it cheap. Same goes for nuclear fusion. If you care about climate change at all, you need to care about cumulative greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, which means we need to start cutting them as soon as possible. Because wind and solar are cheap and scalable today, it makes the most sense to deploy them first and foremost as fast as possible. We may need another complement for them in the future when our power systems near 80% plus wind and solar share, but that point is likely decades away (unfortunately)."

Wind and Solar power are the main culprits behind the Texas grid being less reliable than it should be. 

Pointing the finger at the failures of the Natural Gas pipeline infrastructure is a valid point. The pipelines would have had issues whether or not renewables expanded to the extent they have today and there is no getting around that. 

Still, this ignores the fact that fossil fuel generation has been neglected for the past quarter century due to aggressive green policy agendas that seek to move into a carbon neutral future overnight. 

The massive expansion of renewable generation in West Texas over the past 15 years has come at the expense of more reliable forms of generation and it has been accomplished in an anti competitive fashion, through excessive subsidies and related incentives. 

It’s really a matter of simple economics and it has been playing out for more than a decade. This extreme weather event was the straw that broke the camels back.

Power companies will bankrupt themselves weatherizing their facilities that cost ~$50Mw to run due to fuel prices, because they are forced to run these fossil fuel units unprofitably as they are paid the same auction clearing Mw price as renewable generation, who’s marginal costs are ~$5Mw thanks to excessive subsidies. 


Had reliability of the grid been taken as seriously as the reduction of emissions, through appropriate economic incentives, there would have been more Nuclear Units and Fossil Fuel based generation online, with the ability to increase generation immediately to match the real time demand spike, leading to fewer outages and a more resilient grid overall. 

Control and Resiliency are two features that renewables lack and people need to start realizing that clean energy is unreliable energy, until battery storage technology catches up, and that is at least a decade away."

Wonder why this is the standard on reporting about these. From experience, I'd surmise the storage capacity is close to 30MWh, but usually you have to dig for this information.

It's not exactly the same scale as hydro. I think the largest is in australia with 100+MWh of storage. Usually designed more for short-term balancing, afaik.

edit: this seems to suggest 120MWh, with 30MW effect :

>and a 30-megawatt battery; the battery has a duration of four hours.

Which is nice of course, but good to remember scales (and other potential solutions for long-term storage) :

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage\_hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)

>Pumped storage is by far the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, and, as of 2020, the United States Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database reports that PSH accounts for around 95% of all active tracked storage installations worldwide, with a total installed throughput capacity of over 181 GW, of which about 29 GW are in the United States, and a total installed storage capacity of over 1.6 TWh, of which about 250 GWh are in the United States.

The first ‘utility scale’ renewable energy plant combining solar and wind generation with battery storage opens in the US,"I live in Oregon and have time of use charging from PGE.    As we pick up more wind and solar power, it will be interesting to see how the cost and what times are best change.    I already get some additional bonuses for charging at the right time.    I bet this will increase as there are more renewables, particularly solar, on the grid.

I am concerned with the storage amount.   It says 30MW.    Most of the time, I see grid scale stuff having 4 hours of peak power capacity.    At a site with 300 MW of solar, 120 MWh seems very small to make this plant ""dispatchable""."

Trump rails against wind energy in fundraising pitch to oil executives,"Renewable energy is one of those things that's here to stay and will just keep growing at this point, there's nothing to really stop it now except maybe a more efficient energy source."

Trump rails against wind energy in fundraising pitch to oil executives,California s now meeting it’s needs with renewables. Trump is a traitor.
Trump rails against wind energy in fundraising pitch to oil executives,"Former president [Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/donald-trump-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) repeatedly ranted about wind power during a fundraising [dinner with oil and gas industry executives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/12/oil-drilling-federal-lands-biden/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) last week, falsely claiming that the renewable-energy source is unreliable, unattractive and bad for the environment.

“I hate wind,” Trump told the executives over a meal of chopped steak at his Mar-a-Lago Club and resort in Florida, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.

Trump’s comments reveal how he is wooing potential donors with his long-standing hostility to wind farms and pledges to halt this form of renewable energy if he returns to office. His stance poses a potential threat to one of the linchpins of America’s clean energy transition, according to more than a dozen Trump allies, energy experts and offshore wind industry officials.

Even if [President Biden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/joe-biden-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8) were to win reelection, experts say, opponents of offshore wind will remain emboldened by Trump’s stance and well positioned to challenge a new generation of projects in federal waters.

And if Trump were to return to the White House?

“If I were in the offshore wind industry, I would probably be pretty, pretty nervous,” said a former Trump administration energy official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Trump campaign did not respond to specific questions for this story, and it has not elaborated on his energy policies, which he has often summarized as [“drill, baby, drill.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/16/drill-baby-drill-other-nonsensical-trump-claims-about-inflation/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11) In an emailed statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president would “make America energy dominant again.”

How Much the Oil and Gas Industry Paid Texas Republicans Who Are Lying About Wind Energy,"Fundamental point here: 

>	What’s happening in Texas right now is a perfect storm of poor planning, crazy weather, and a widespread government failure to prepare the electric grid. Fossil fuels had a big part to play in how this disaster went down as natural gas and coal sources failed at multiple points, from energy sources themselves freezing to pipelines shutting down. The Texas grid’s terrible setup—a lack of integration with other states to ensure a consistent power supply, lagging weatherization updates, predatory pricing habits—can’t be tied to one source, but politicians like Crenshaw, Cruz, and Abbott are choosing to hammer down on renewables while blessing fossil fuels, similar to how they’ve reacted during California’s blackouts in recent years. While it’s impossible to say why, their donations tell a pretty damning story here—and research has shown donors make it rain on politicians who do their bidding."

China’s wind farms can now produce more energy than all of America’s nuclear plants,"Projected energy “needs” are grossly exaggerated by Industry, by not taking into account the imperative results of a massive emergency war effort campaign for optimal energy efficiency, conservation, and application of appropriate technologies…including R&D, especially on storage...nor the economy of scale from such an all-out national effort, which would further exponentially reduce ""costs"", as well as putting everyone back to work, to boot.

Even with presently deployable tech, distributed energy production for local use can meet virtually all local needs, without any “need” for nukes, or fossil fuels…and feed substantial excess power to the grid, as well, especially with long-needed upgrade of transmission lines and storage. 

Massive solar “farms”, or even a few of the latest EPA approved nuke designs, may conceivably be appropriate for some of the largest scale urban or industrial applications…where those cannot be relocated to an area where a sufficient appropriate combo of hydro, solar, wind, tidal and geothermal power is available...climate change, whatever we do now, will still irreversibly compel relocation of massive numbers of people, all over the world, anyway.

The main thing standing in the way of moar nukes presently is that the Industry is balking at EPA mandated safety and security regulations, which, go figure, Industry says are “too expensive”. 

Which, considering Industry’s consistent arguably criminal, even treasonous pattern of practice these many years against the public interest, in defiance of the popular democratic mandate, does not enhance credibility of Industry “advice” or “science” regarding “energy needs” and how to meet them.

Then, of course, there’s still the problem of all the extremely nasty nuclear waste already generated, and to be generated, and wtf to do with it, which Still has not been resolved, with some old storage facilities starting to leak egregiously.

If and when the nuclear power industry is able and willing to resolve the costs and cleanup issues, subject to very strict EPA regulation, Ima willing to consider deployment of the latest high-tech EPA approved designs, maybe, if proven “needed”…and safe “enough”, scientifically.

Or, we could just arrest their jive asses, and seize their assets.

Meanwhile, however, we need to go green all the way, soonest, to save the planet, seems to me."

The US Energy Information Administration estimates we are at 20% renewable in our energy mix and projected to increase about 1% per year for the next few years. Natural gas use is projected to decrease 1% per year for the next few years as well. I found that interesting. 

China seems to just be trying to bring any and all sources of power online as quickly as they can. The article said 50% of new power brought online by 2025 will be from renewables. It doesn’t say what the other 50% will come from, but I would guess coal. Odd to be both the world’s biggest polluter (burning almost half the worlds coals) and the biggest user of renewables."

What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"If we can change some of our energy use cycles, we can use more energy directly and store less. There's a few % of inefficiency in an energy storage system. The more we can sidestep that, the more energy is available. eg if we use energy generated while the batteries are topped up, we can gain a couple of % bypassing the batteries."

What’s the real question you’re looking for an answer to?"
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"What do you mean by ""needs to be stored""? Stored for what purpose?

70% of my states electricity comes from wind and solar. In summer, it often reaches over 100%, and the excess is sold to the eastern states. 

We had what was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world, 129 MWh and 100 MW. That was then expanded to 194 MWh at 150 MW.

The battery is not there to run a town for an extended period of time, or anything like that, it's just to keep the flow of electricity stable, to minimise blackouts. 

Instead, the backup for the grid is supposed to come from home solar. 30% of houses here have solar panels, thus they have a battery."
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"The excess energy needs to be stored, the rest can be used."
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"This is a very complicated question and it depends on many factors. You also need to be clear on what it is you're actually asking.

For example, if we relied on wind 100%, the question would be: how many hours or days in a row with negligible wind could we have before the storage ran out?

So there won't really be one answer. The more storage we have (plus the more consistent our production and consumption is) the longer a grid could withstand dips on production."
What percentage of created solar/wind energy needs to be stored and how much can be used directly?,"Do you just mean how much solar and wind energy has to be curtailed because there is not demand for it at that moment?

Wind Energy to power your home?,"I've done this exercise a couple of times.  The technologies are changing swiftly and my research was specific to the US, so i can only speak in general relationships, not exact numbers.  The long and short of the matter is that for your cost per-installed-watt is going to be 2-3 times higher by going with wind power than it will be with solar for micro-turbines in the 5-20 kW range.  So if you calculate your solar payback as, say, 10 years, it will be 20-30 years with wind.  This relationship changes when you get closer to commercial wind turbines which average 2.75 MW."

Vibrating wind turbine,"Copied from the post on r/nextfuckinglevel:

“Interested to see the energy output compared to a standard turbine, they conveniently left it out which makes me very skeptical.

Edit: Someone wrote this in response

“A standard full-sized wind turbine produces roughly 1.5-2 Megawatts (1,500,000-2,000,000 W) at optimal wind speeds and optimal wind directions (which depends on the model), and then diminish at subobtimal conditions.

The bladeless turbine however is estimated to output only 100W, or around a staggering 0.0066 - 0.005% the output of a traditional turbine. But the targetted audience is completely different.” “"
Vibrating wind turbine,What's the power output? I bet it's absolutely horrendous compared to hawt:s.
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,"From someone that lives in windy state, these are very common. But there are tons of things that you must take into consideration. There is a minimum amount of wind required to generate that can be effected by placement, trees, structures and geographical features. The turbine needs an engine break, which essentially disengages the clutch if it spins too fast (travel through the plains states and look at the older massive turbines that have black oil all down their pilars, this is from over spinning and can cause parts to break or prematurely fail). You will need an electrician to wire it to your structure or the battery bank to you structure. Yes you will need a battery bank if you plan on storing energy for windless days. You will most likely need a platform poured unless you pan to attach this to an existing structure, which may interfere with energy production. Depending on how much electricity your household utilizes, this may exceed the cost to benefit ratio. If you over produce, your electric company may or may not pay you for that additional electricity, depends on the state. Not to mention, you want to make certain whatever brand you select has replacement parts, some of the cheaper models do not offer this. Link below is a starting place for home turbines

Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,Interesting to hear how this works. Would be a great option for remote cabins or small homes that aren’t already on the grid
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,"Interesting, but you'd probably be better served spending the money on a solar panel that doesn't have any moving parts, is easier to install, and does not require maintenance."
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,The foundation will cost you a lot more than that.
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,"Solar is WAY more cost effective. You cannot attach them to existing structures without generating vibrations. Vibration causes problems. You need strong, consistent wind to generate anywhere near the rated capacity. You need protections in the event of over-generation or over-speed. Lots of problems for little upside, solar is better in 99% of use cases."
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,"I'm doing a school project right now where I'm logging wind speeds on a day to day basis. These turbines are rated for their rated power at ~20mph winds. Where I live, wind speeds keep bouncing between 3 to 9 mph. If I got this turbine, I would make full power ONCE a year, in a storm. For the rest of the year, I would make less than 240 wh a day. Instead, if I bought a $100 100 watt solar panel, I would make roughly 400 wh in a day, on average.
If I bought the wind turbine, I'm effectively paying $400 for a thing that is realistically going to generate only half the power of something that is 1/4 the price.

I'm not saying these home wind turbines are a bad idea, it's just that there is not really as much research going into them. And even if there was, the installation process would be much less flexible than solar. For a wind turbine that generates 100 watts reliably in my area, it would have to have at least a 1000w rating, and that would be A HUGE turbine. On the other hand, 100w solar panels are small, when compared to the equivalent wind turbine.

I can only see wind turbines be practical when they are used commercially. Otherwise, a home turbine would require much more thought than just buying something from online."
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,Wind in residential areas is quite turbulent and not overly suitable for wind turbines. You need to be in big open areas like large rural properties to get any benefit out of them.
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,Maybe there have been improvements but in my experience these little turbines are loud. At this scale PV may be a better option.
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,"I think wind doesn’t get cost effective until ~6kw turbine range due to parts failure, installation costs, and such. A regular house could probably install 6kw as it’s roughly $20,000 and only 18ft blades. Has a similar output to equal cost solar panels at that price too. 

Wind does tend to outperform solar as you get to the $100,000+ range right now."
Costco sells a 400W wind turbine for $400,Can I buy this and plug it in to reduce or replace my electric bill?
