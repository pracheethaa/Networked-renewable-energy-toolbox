Nuclear energy to the rescue: France got it right,This is a great 3 part series to read.
Why France is eyeing nuclear power again,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614579/why-france-is-eyeing-nuclear-power-again/) reduced by 73%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> This week Le Monde reported that the government asked EDF, the country&#039;s main state-controlled energy company, to work up plans to build three new nuclear plants, each with a pair of its EPR reactors.

> French nuclear regulators pushed for safety upgrades to existing plants, and in 2015 the government voted to cut the share of nuclear in the nation&#039;s energy supply to 50% by 2025.In recent years, the nuclear industry has struggled in general amid safety concerns, rising competition from natural gas and renewables, and high-profile development boondoggles.

> So building six reactors wouldn&#039;t necessarily increase the share of electricity produced by nuclear plants across the nation, particularly as demand increases in the coming years.

Nuclear Power by Country 2020,[removed]
My thoughts on Nuclear.,"I understand your concerns about the safety of nuclear power and they are legitimate concerns, but you are completely ignoring the advantages. Nuclear power is the only form of ""cleaner"" energy that can realistically compete with coal power plants and other similar fossil fuel power sources. The design failures you mentioned are extremely rare and because of the amount of danger that a malfunction poses, more failsafes and precautions are put in place on nuclear reactors than anything else in the world. The biggest problem with nuclear power is what to do with the waste that it generates, we need a better solution than bury it. Nuclear power has its problems but the benefits outweigh the negatives."
My thoughts on Nuclear.,"There is no solution without nuclear Energy at the moment,
we will see a massive Explosion in the World-Population and this People must get Energy because Progress is the only Way to stop overpopulation.

There is no Progress without Energy.

Also look for the environmental Damage of the Inga Dam,
as well as all the Hydro-Power Stations in northern India (& etc.)

Look for the Airpollution in China, look for Oilsand in Canada, Fracking in the USA, the ""War for Oil"", etc.!

Of course, there is no 100% Security but this is a ""normal Problem"" and we face it every single Day, 24/7/365.

My thoughts on Nuclear.,[deleted]
My thoughts on Nuclear.,"looks like your points already have opposing and well structred arguments, i havent done enough research to add more arguments but i just wanted to say this: when you read about plane crashing disasters killing hundreds and whatnot, doesn't it feel like travelling by plane is the worst evil of all? [after all these horrible accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft), wouldn't one think that planes kill more on average and would rather stick to, say cars? however this is not the case, according to NSC, [you're more likely to die of a car crash than of an aircraft related incident](http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx), but if cars kill more why isnt that emphasized on? because plane crashes are so rare that once they happen, the media just cant get enough of blabbering about it, but the many car crashes per day that kill around 10~ on average? meh. 

this bias is more or less the same thing with nuclear energy and its competitors:coal and petrol based electricity. reactor meltdowns are big news and stay on the headlines for even weeks when they do happen, but in everyday life? you're more likely to get asthma or other breathing diseases from the toxic emissions of gasoline based cars and coal burning etc(they say it causes cancer too but i'm not sure about that one) than to be killed by the radiation of a reactor that has failed. supporting the nuclear energy industry and not bashing it like witchcraft would lead to improved designs that are more efficient, produce less waste, and you know, less likely to go kaboom(by the way, it's worth noting that in the case of fukushima, the failure was directly linked to the tsunami that hit the area, the plants that were way above sea level didnt fail IIRC, but i'm not sure about this one either, excuse my lack of research). hell we already have designs that aim to get rid of the waste that comes from other reactors too (the waste is mostly Uranium-238 that doesn't seem to fission nearly as well as the initial Uranium-235, which is why it couldnt be used in conventional reactors) like breeder reactors. 

sure, solar and wind leave no waste whatsoever, but generating electricity from them requires specific weather conditions that cannot always be guaranteed, and storage is a bit of an issue too as conventional battery designs still can't deal with storing so much electricity that can power an entire city, fission fuel can be stored for on demand use and doesn't need to wait for the sun to shine and the air density/ambient temperature to be just right etc.., it can also be used in applications where solar/wind is just not an option(like nuclear submarines)."

Edit: Damn, it gets worse. Dumping irradiated cooling water in to the Pacific should NOT be viewed as a positive development for the nuclear industry in any way. There is simply no way to positively spin it from a PR perspective. Wow."
On being pro nuclear energy(?) and anti nuclear weapons,"The future is fission. :) Fusion is perpetually decades away from even functioning at all, let alone being used in a commercial power plant.  Fission exists now, has for decades, and is a fantastic power source.

As for separating nuclear power and weapons, it's a viable position.  There are even states like North Korea that have a nuclear weapons program and no nuclear power. (Bomb grade uranium can be produced without a nuclear reactor just fine using centrifuge isotope separation.)"
On being pro nuclear energy(?) and anti nuclear weapons,"When it comes to fusion ‚Äî in the 1970s there was research on inertial confinement for power production, but most everything since that time has been directed to understanding and modelling the phenomena of thermonuclear explosions, in the context of a world in which the international political order is based on nuclear deterrence, but actually testing the weapons is largely taboo. To some extent, that's not about what the physicists want to do, but about what they can get funding for. But it's also true that getting power out of an ICF system is at least as difficult as getting it out of a magnetic-confinement system. When people start talking seriously about porous ceramic walls weeping liquid lithium, and about 99% recovery of unburned tritium, it should be clear that the engineering challenges are such that we shouldn't expect a practical, economic powerplant any time soon.

Now, when it comes to fission, the key thing to realize is that, yes, there is some overlap between the technology required for power and the technology required for bombs. But if you look at any of the countries which have actually built bombs, you will see that none of them have used nuclear power plants or fuel-cycle facilities built for civil purposes to get to that point. To the contrary : Britain, after building its first bombs using plutonium from the Windscale piles, built Calder Hall and Chapelcross to make weapons plutonium with electricity as a by-product, and then operated those plants for decades as pure power-producers. Similarly, the British enrichment plant was originally built to provide weapons material, and then switched over to civil fuel.

In most cases, countries which have built bombs did so before they built power plants ; China is an extreme example. And in Pakistan, although the CANDU-type Karachi power plant was operating for many years before an attempt was made to build a bomb, that bomb used highly enriched uranium from clandestine centrifuges.

Honestly, if you ask me about the link between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, I'll tell you that the only time nuclear weapons have been used in war was in a war that started over control of oil supplies. The longer we allow control of fossil fuels to dominate world politics, the more chances there are that someone will decide to use nuclear weapons. You certainly can't eliminate nuclear weapons by banning civil fission power."
On being pro nuclear energy(?) and anti nuclear weapons,"I don't find it complicated anymore. I'm pro water, but anti-waterboarding or drowning people. I'm pro-fire, but anti fire-bombing cities.  Really it's kind of a classic ""it's not the poisonit's  the dose""."
On being pro nuclear energy(?) and anti nuclear weapons,"Yo, forget about fusion for a moment because it is off the table at least for the next 100 years. Lets talk about fission insted, which we have and use. Enriched uranium follows mainly 4 enrichment levels. You need enriched uranium to do both fuel and bombs, being that they follow the principle of chain reaction (tho inside a reactor it is controlled, while in a bomb it is purposefully not), this is very very simplified.

Natural Uranium: ‚âà99.3% 238U which is stable, ‚âà0.7% 235U which is radioactive

Low Enriched Uranium: 3-5% 235U

Highly Enriched Uranium: up to 20% 235U

Military Grade Uranium: >85% 235U

This means basically that a reactor could never explode as a bomb, in fact it never happened and the worst case scenario is the melting of the core and the emission outside of radionuclides and radiation (extremely rare)."
Pipe dream about Nuclear energy,"I'm not really sure what you're asking here. 

Firstly, what are you talking about with Nuclear Power Plants producing fallout?  I'm sure you meant another word, as they most certainly do not produce fallout. 

What I gather you're talking about it reusing spent fuel to be put in some sort of battery?  

This technology does exist, they're called Betavoltaic Batteries, they use beta emissions from decaying particles.  They arnt very efficient and would need a lot of them to be even remotely usable. 

With that said, Spent Nuclear Fuel does still contain A LOT of energy, but trying to cupture any radiation it produces is rather pointless.  Even trying to heat water or some other medium with this decay heat just isn't worth it. 

Realistically, reprocessing this fuel is our best option currently, which some countries actually do, allowing it to be re-used.  Or we could deploy fast/breeder reactors that can use this spent fuel and produce usable fuel for current reactor types."
"Hey, starting a Nuclear Energy Newsletter ‚Äì wanna join?","Well, that's cool.

I am from Pakistan. We are facing worst energy crisis and it will be get worse in upcoming years. So our govt. collaborated with Chinese authorities and they have launched ‚ÄúPressurized water nuclear reactor‚Äù. To what extent it is safe?,"Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are probably the best understood type of reactor there is. They have a long history of use dating back to the 50's, and have gone through an absolutely mammoth amount of study and improvement over the years. They are the gold standard not only for safety but for efficiency. 

From what I can tell from this brief skim, this has all the hallmarks of a safe PWR. Active and passive safety systems, double containment, etc.

If this were being built by say, American, Canadian, French or Korean reactor designers, I'd be very confident in saying this is an safe and reliable system that will deliver clean power and jobs for decades to come. As it stands... Well, I know China has been building dozen(s) of reactors of all types. I do not know what standards they keep to, or what regulatory body they're accountable to.

If youre concerned, I would ask that you push for more regulatory transparency and ensuring that corners aren't cut on what should be an incredibly safe design."

The main caveat I would make is that their safety record has been created mostly in countries that put a great deal of effort into safe construction and operations, and have regulatory agencies with real power to require changes.  Also, a free press that reports (and often exaggerates) any off-normal operation."
I am from Pakistan. We are facing worst energy crisis and it will be get worse in upcoming years. So our govt. collaborated with Chinese authorities and they have launched ‚ÄúPressurized water nuclear reactor‚Äù. To what extent it is safe?,"The Hualong reactors are more or less a copy of the French EPR, so the design is safe. The make or break difference in safety and reliability depends upon the operator and not the builder, just like a good driver with a car. Sure, it pays to invest in an extremely safe car with built in contingencies, but it all boils down to the driver. That said, Pakistan wised up in building these reactors, and one thing to keep in observation would be a constant supply of fuel and maintenance of technological continuity(training your engineers to a consistent standard, regulations to a consistent standard) after the Chinese engineers leave, that's where you will have to expect that  the government does its job. I would assume, that since it has more units built than just the Karachi units, and has a record of safe ops, these things are being taken care of."

1.28 trillion euros (invested in renewables) + 39 billion euros (not spent on nuclear) = 1.30 trillion euros that would be spent on nuclear?  Wlid savings there.

"/r/energy is overrun by nuclear advocates: bring up storage for renewables, get downvoted below visibility","It's particularly annoying because there are so many interesting discussions we could be having about how to accommodate renewable variability on the grid by dispatching demand response/demand flexibility (including EVs) and energy storage, as well as through improved prediction, technological and geographic diversification, risk-minimizing optimal dispatch, and probably some degree of overbuilding and curtailment.

But instead it's just ""renewables are variable and intermittent/aren't dispatchable/can't provide baseload power, therefore nuclear is the only option."" 

Although there are some solid arguments to be made in favor of encouraging the buildout of new nuclear generation capacity, the fact of the matter is that renewables are already being deployed at a rapid and increasing pace due to some combination of near cost parity and favorable policy incentives, and advanced nuclear reactors designs are still largely untested and have huge regulatory and permitting hurdles ahead of them.

I also think that for something as important as our electrical needs, diversification of sources isn't a bad idea.

'No higher cost energy': nuclear has drained Germany of more than ‚Ç¨1trn to date,"For what it's worth, I'm not really in favour of opening new nuclear reactors, since solar and wind is now cheaper than gas and coal power plants.

However, what Germany has done which is absolutely and patently stupid, was shut down nuclear power plants literally decades ahead of their planned decommission, and having to rely more on coal and natural gas powerplants to fill the void from the perfectly-functional nuclear power plants they shut down.

Had they simply kept the nuclear reactors open for the rest of their planned life and built up solar and wind as fast as possible, they could have kept a far greener grid without needing to rely more on coal and gas.

So yeah, I like the idea of nuclear, I'm a big fan of the CANDU reactor (using unenriched uranium, cannot be used to make nuclear weapons, can be used to make medical isotopes, easy to maintain and service, fewer radioactive wastes, can use radioactive waste from light water reactors to burn them up a 2nd time, etc) but I recognize it's just a very expensive source of energy that cannot compete with wind and solar.

I like nuclear, but despite all that I'm still against making more nuclear reactors in favour of more wind and solar."

The 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change,"Interesting, raises some good and valid points. The only problem is they compare the time and cost of a single nuclear plant to a single wind/water/solar plant, which is not a fair comparison because a nuclear reactor produces (and I believe this is the scientific term) a shitload more energy in a far shorter time, so it really should be 5 reasons. But definitely interesting and convincing."
The 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change,"Many good ppints across the board but the article seems to tackle the issue of short term energy production where small scale like wind and solar are easy to deploy. Also, storage ideas are not entirely ready for large scale without a certain fallout of sorts. 
Long term and increasing needs of developing countries cannot be met with such a solution.
In addition, we always talk about the form of nuclear that we each have experienced in a specific usage scenario. Scaling nuclear is easy, and we should be investing on new types of nuclear that may be better suited for distributed power.
Unfortunately the topic is massively complex and there are huge vested interests on all sides so what we use will be more related to who lobbies more and has the right people in the right positions."
The 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change,"Points 2 and 4 to 7 are totally invalid, as they relate to the supposed dangers of nuclear power. Nuclear is and has always been the safest of any energy source we have.

**More people have died from installing solar panels than have died from nuclear disasters.** For every TWh of energy produced, 0.04 people die from nuclear power, and about 155,000TWh of energy is produced globally every year.  That means in a year, only **6200 people die** from **nuclear energy** production, **68200 people** **die** from falling off rooftops while installing **solar panels**, and **15,500,000 die** from **coal** mining and air pollution  [(I got the figures from this site)](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html). Nuclear power beats every other source in deaths per TWh produced.

Here I address the points in that article:

* 2. The cost would soon be outweighed by the amount of energy it can produce. It is much cheaper than other renewables.
* 4. Meltdowns happen extremely rarely and usually aren't much of a danger due modern technology.
* 5. The mining is much safer than coal, no humans actually go into uranium mines, acid is flushed down pipes to dissolve the uranium.
* 6. I haven't really look into the CO2 cost of nuclear plants, but I can guarantee that the ratio between the energy it produced and its CO2 cost is better than most of the other sources.
* 7. The waste from nuclear power is only a few meters cubed, compare that to the literal kilometres cubed of CO2 we dump into the atmosphere from fossil fuels. Solar panels take up huge amounts of area to produce little energy and hydroelectricity requires vast amounts of land to be flooded.

Nuclear power is the **most practical energy source** we can use to prevent a climate disaster in the next century. Other renewables  are too costly, take up too much area and are often inconsistent. We can use nuclear power as a temporary source until renewable energy sources improve. The only reason we are not using more nuclear energy is fear-mongering  and misinformation from green parties and the anti-nuclear hippie movement."
The 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change,"Sorry to break it to you but some of this is factually wrong.

The most blatant thing is the cost comparisons. The idea that wind and solar are way cheaper than Nuclear is, just, completely wrong, and it's an idea that's being spread by people who don't understand *anything* to do with the science.

All the claims that wind and solar are way cheaper than nuclear are dependent on KW/H production. On pure numbers it looks fine from the outside. They produce twice as much KW/H per dollar!

Problem is, this doesn't account for the fact that the sun doesn't shine half the day, and the wind isn't blowing all the time.

Yeah, on pure KW/H, solar is cheaper. The sun also doesn't shine at night time. So you have to take that into account by roughly doubling whatever estimate you have for your solar cost. (Because in order to even have electricity at night time, it has to be stored somehow, or just come from a different source).

That means after taking this into account, nuclear and solar/wind are actually fairly closely priced."

"Rivers could generate thousands of nuclear power plants worth of energy, thanks to a new ‚Äòblue‚Äô membrane","Can anyone help me understand their calculation?

The article says:

>a single square meter of the membrane‚Äîpacked with millions of pores per square centimeter‚Äîcould generate about 30 megawatt hours per year. That‚Äôs enough to power more than 400 homes.

But by my calculation, 30 MWh = 30000 kWh. Divide this by the estimated 400 homes, and that yields 75 kWh per home per year.

But if you check a list of countries' [average electricity consumption per dwelling](https://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/efficiency-by-sector/households/electricity-consumption-dwelling.html), there's not a single European country that uses less than 1000 kWh per home per year. This is obviously much more than just 75 kWh/home/year.

And you could say that the article could be referring to countries with lower energy consumption, but if that's the case, they should really specify. [And even poorer countries have a consumption rate that is usually on the magnitude of 1000 kWh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption). Yes, this source is about total consumption per person, not per house. And it includes non-home electricity, in addition to household electricity. But if you compare the two sources there's typically about a 1.2x multiplication factor when switching from home consumption to consumption per person which holds true for most countries.

Anyone know why the article claims that 400 homes can be powered by a square meter? It just seems like bad math."

> I really don't understand why everyone is going against nuclear energy these days. 

I really don't understand why some people are blind to the reality of the costs and dangers of nuclear energy - even when they have been brought front and centre by recent events. How bad would it need to be before some people could see past the nuclear fantasy and accept the reality of the societal dangers presented by nuclear energy?

> You can't really compare Fukushima to Chernobyl: 

""A nuclear complex suffered catastrophic failure as a result of a series of events that breached the safety mechanisms and limits of the plant. As a result, massive quantities of radioactive material was released in to the environment and hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes. The IAEA assigned it a level 7 on the INES scale - the most severe.""

Does that describe Chernobyl or Fukushima?

Denial of reality does not make it go away.

> Fukushima was a state of the art facility...

Completely wrong. Fukushima had known design weaknesses and engineers resigned because their warnings were not heeded.

> ... that was hit by a one in a thousand year natural disaster...

Completely wrong. Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Japan with monotonous regularity. [Major tsunamis strike multiple times each century](http://historyofgeology.blogspot.com/2011/03/historic-tsunamis-in-japan.html). Seven major earthquakes / tsunamis hit Japan in the 20th century. Fukushima was not designed to withstand an event which had a high probability of happening because the nuke corporation chose profits over safety. About one quarter of the USA's nukes share a similar design - including San Ofre on the Californian coast.

We can speculate about how many other nukes around the world have also been designed to favour profits over safety. Unfortunately, the only way we ever find out is when things go wrong and then it's too late.

> ...whereas Chernobyl was a poorly designed Soviet facility that was poorly run. 

No. It was an old design that had fewer safety features than later designs - that does not mean later designs are now magically infallible. Human error caused the Chernobyl meltdown - just as human error and 'not enough safety systems' could hit any other nuke on the planet.

> The radiation release was different by orders of magnitude.

Fukushima is not finished. No one knows the full extent of the disaster and won't for a long time yet. Some estimates say that it already compares with Chernobyl.

> Nuclear energy is much safer than fossil fuel use. 

No one is advocating fossil fuels. Nukes absorb massive amounts of money that could be better used to deploy clean, safe renewable energy *now*.

> Check out the documentary Gas Land about the effects of natural gas on groundwater. 

Another reason to move even more quickly to 100% clean, safe renewable energy.

> Or the coal ash spill in Tennessee which is one of the largest spills of toxic waste in US history. 

Another reason to move even more quickly to 100% clean, safe renewable energy.

> Heck, every year more people are killed while mining coal in America than are killed in nuclear accidents around the world.

Another reason to move even more quickly to 100% clean, safe renewable energy.

> What I'm trying to say is that while renewable energy is much preferable to nuclear, we shouldn't be fighting nuclear energy and should instead focus on fighting against fossil fuel use.

We can do both. Fight dirty, dangerous coal and fight dirty, dangerous, expensive nuclear - while promoting clean, safe renewable energy. In fact, if you read the sidebar you can see that is exactly what this sub-reddit is for.

> Edit: XKCD's radiation chart is also a good source of info on radiation output and what dangers they present.

No, it's a misleading graphic that makes no distinction between internal and external emitters of radiation. Plutonium in your lungs or strontium in your bones is very different to having an x-ray at the dentist or taking a long-haul flight. But why would that need explaining to anyone?!

As that comic says in the footnote: ‚Äú*If you‚Äôre basing radiation safety procedures on an internet image and things go wrong, you have no one to blame but yourself.*‚Äù

Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,But I have a lot of money invested in promoting nuclear energy and stand to make a fortune from the building of new plants!
Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,"Renewables are the future.  Oil, coal, and fissionable material will eventually run out regardless of the vested interests and the politicians they influence (own).

The problem is that renewables can't support our current lifestyles (pun not intended but welcomed), so we have to make a choice as to what will fill the gaps until they take over.  If we go with coal and/or natural gas, in 20 to 50 years when renewables own the day, we can mothball the old plants and move on.

If we go with nuclear, in 20 to 50 years we can mothball the old plants and then spend considerable resources dealing with the tons and tons of deadly nuclear waste.

There's also the complacency factor.  You really want to shut down coal as soon as possible because it's dumping carbon into the air, so there's motivation to get things done with clean energy sources.

With nuclear, you kind of forget about it until something goes horribly, horribly wrong as things have a way of eventually doing.  Nuclear advocates claim how the next generation of plants are so much better than the previous generation that they're virtually fail-safe.  I'm sure if we had access to the debates on nuclear from 40 years ago, they would have said the exact same thing.

When Fukushima and Chernobyl were built, I doubt you'll find experts from the time saying that, while these plants are a little dodgy, the ones coming in forty years will be perfectly safe.  No, they said those old plants were perfectly safe *then* the same way they're saying the new ones are now. (And they were mostly right, just as their future predictions will be *mostly* right.)

Lastly, old energy won't suddenly just disappear.  It will likely linger on for decades as a backup source of power.  Of coal, gas, oil, and nuclear sitting there rusting away, it's easy to see how the first three are preferable to the last (if you're reasonably objective)."
Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,"> the choice is not between nukes and coal deaths, it's between nukes and safe, clean renewable energy.

Bingo. Thanks for mentioning that. If we, as a society, agree to halt global warming and replace coal plants, then we've already made the choice between coal and other options. At that point, the choice is between nuclear and renewables, as you mention, and nuclear is difficult to justify in that comparison."
Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,"Nuke energy retains the status quo, monopoly corps that will jack up the price year after year. 

Renewables allow everyone to play a part, the farmer, the factories, the house, the business office and the plethora of companies that can provide a fail safe mix of disparate, interconnected and distributed grid systems. 

The financial side is also that everyone gets to play a part in a renewable landscape. The less you use the more you can sell. The more energy your farms can grow the more you can sell. Better harvest? More energy!

Business too can benefit from efficiency and new technology. Personal business and smaller operators, local and regional can employ people across any nation and even remotely monitor and managed many of the new technologies available. Brazil's new offshore 170mw turbine array will be monitored in Europe. 

Renewable energy also offers us a chance to finally recycle anything and everything we make and in the process of doing so, create energy not consume it. Toxic landfill that is a waste of space, a pollution pit and an expense to everyone. Most things we have now can be reduced to its base components using fracturing hydrolysis, Syn gas generation and bio composting for massive amounts of readily usable methane (natural gas). If you stuck a car in high pressure cooker the end result would be 40% gases from plastics and rubbers, base oils, paint pigments and metals (copper, zinc, chromium, lead, tin, alumina, gold, nickel, cadmium, magnesium and iron. Most people don't know the embedded energy in the plastics of cars can be extracted to make energy, crushing a car can generate a few kilowatts instead of using it. 

Noe one is doing this yet but it can be done.

We are using the wrong model. We are using a corporate model, the one where you use and toss away. Along the way someone makes money until its buried.

We need a new way where food is energy, energy as its grown (hay to bio fuel or methane) or the waste to methane. The end result is fertiliser. From the farm to house to the factory and back to the farm. From the pit in the ground to endless loops of usage. 

Homes need to be more energy efficient. Homes in colder areas need better insulation, better construction and more efficient heating system based on a standard geo-thermal loop ground coupled energy system.

Solar needs to be standard. Green roofs and garden space above car ports needs to be standard. Water storage under your car port needs to be standard. (A double car car port can store 70,000lts, enough for a year).

Cars need to be at least electric but the town itself should be designed with public transport in mind from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

Every time I see a new pre fab warehouse or small shop go up I think, ""if only they dropped a concrete slab on top too, then someone else could grow food up there"". Millions of acres wasted to heat gathering metal roofs that then in turn heat internally to force the use of air conditioning. Its a massive waste.

Why don't freeways and other reserves have wind turbines on or near them. Why are there no rail lines running down the middle of them?

Why do cities even build more freeways when everyone knows they simply don't work. 

Nuke energy will dominate unless we stop it. They want us, tax payers to prop them up and then they will charge us for it. Fuck no! 

Use your carbon taxes and trading schemes to invest in long term, real energy. create a mix of systems that ensure stability. Stop using the monopoly model pioneered by Westinghouse and GE at the beginning of last century. 

Those wires out the front of your house should be your excuse to invest in solar and so forth. Put into that grid and you make money. Keep sucking from it and you will pay some fat rich asshole even more than they already have.

Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,"Each source of energy has its advantages and disadvantages, and I agree that a lot of arguments for nuclear overlook worst case scenarios or use statistics to make fallacious arguments. Despite this, I think if people do start to panic due to a sudden increase in oil prices or the decrease of oil reserves, nuclear will be the first thing people turn to. 

Also, one of the major providers of alternative energy, hydroelectric dams, have one potential risk that is largely overlooked: collapse. There are many dams around the US that are not maintained properly, which could make collapse commonplace if something isn't done. 

We need to make sure that we preemptively address these issues, whether it be maintaining infrastructure, to building more renewable energy sources, to developing better and safer forms of nuclear power (fusion [not cold fusion] and [the probably over hyped] thorium reactors)."
Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,"Thankyou for this, it puts it better than I could and even teaches me something new( the stats on deaths(. Speaking of which, it might be worth linking to the sources (yes, yes, I know, I'm lazy. Sorry.) FWIW, another point worth considering is that known sources of nuclear fuels are finite, as much as any fossil fuels, and storing up trouble in terms of another finite resource seems... less than intelligent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium also would have us know that while Canada is a major producer, neither the US or the UK is.

I have nothing against nuclear. I think in theory it's the most amazing source of power, but in practice it's just too expensive. On one hand you have a technology advancing in cost, efficiency, and industry size. On the other you have a technology that's getting ever more expensive and falling behind in many aspects as time passes. 

Even if we were to subsidize it (more than what we have by creating government-funded waste zones and by having the government insure the plants) it's still not dispatchable, meaning it has to keep on generating even if power prices fall to $0. 

There are too many issues to solve with nuclear, the simplest of which is just cost. "

Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"Because France did not have easy access to fossil fuel (outside of coal), nuclear energy was seen as a way to energy independence.

Of course views have changed since the Chernobyl and Fukushima incident, but AFAIK French nuclear reactor are way safer than the ones used in Chernobyl and is not exposed to the same natural hazards as Japan.

Nevertheless, some ecologists are still trying to demonstrate how unsafe nuclear power plants are by trying to show how vulnerable they can be to terrorist attack.

Overall because France is exporting a lot of its nuclear electricity, I think that the impact of French economy is well appreciated."
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"well, here is a recent article:

[https://www.lepoint.fr/economie/les-francais-soutiennent-de-plus-en-plus-le-nucleaire-10-03-2021-2417244\_28.php](https://www.lepoint.fr/economie/les-francais-soutiennent-de-plus-en-plus-le-nucleaire-10-03-2021-2417244_28.php)

43% for, 30% against.

recently we closed a reactor.

numbers are better that what they used to be after fukushima.

10 years back i used to be against it because it is very easy to see the drawbacks like risks, wastes, tv lies, ties to the military but not as easy to see the benefits.

however we are going to be so fucked with the global warming + end of cheap oil combo. i do hope more people are changing their minds."
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"This sub is heavily pro-nuclear, but it doesn't represent france at all.

Nuclear energy saw a very high disapproval in the late 2000s/early  2010s. With the mediatization of climate change, its popularity is rising back up as people get informed. There was a poll in 2015 I think where a majority of people though that nuclear power plants emitted CO2 from their coolants as if they were coal power plant chimneys."
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,[deleted]
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"From what I see, there is really two side in France. I am a student in engineering and I plan to continue my studies in nuclear industry so I have a strong opinion on it. 
But if I look around me, a lot of people actually perceive nuclear as a very bad thing. A lot of people who didn't studied in science area, a lot of climate activists, even some colleague students in science! 

For example ecologist party recently elected its candidate for presidency (soon 2022), among 5 candidate NONE was pro nuclear.

But I have the feeling things are slowly changing, and people are accepting a more reasonable point of view. ü§û"
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,[deleted]
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy," A quite complex story.

To try to make it short, it was a major decision from the 60s, for various amount of reasons, but with the vision of making France independent, energetically and geopolitically. By having a strong nuclear industry, we back up the nuke development, the sub propulsion, a high tech industry, the whole chain of uranium enrichment, treating/storing the waste, and having an extraordinarily dense electricity production mean, and on top of it, clean (not sure it was the main concern back then, but it is a really nice side-effect). The CEA, a gigantic lab was created for that for instance.

Now over the years, with the various incident and accidents (chernobyl, etc), nuclear started to lose its gloss. Moreover, it has always been a subject completely pushed aside by the media, excepted to point an incident... And the green/ecolos here raised a strong voice against it (noisy minority). So ironically, you have now the greens who wants to get out of it to fight climate change (which is a cognitive dissonance as it basically means to reopen coal/gas/oil factories to compensate the intermittent aspect as the amount of storage requires is just ludicrous). But note at the same time that it makes us more dependent to fossil fuel(oil from middle east and gas from Russia, given the production in the northen sea is declining), which we picked nuclear to specifically avoid... And it was used for electoral purposes, (closing a reactor to satisfy the green voters). Sidenote: the original plan was to reuse multiple times the waste from the first generation of reactors to keep degrading them, making for a really cool  effect: getting rid of the waste, producing energy, reducing further the dependence for uranium importation and making France even more independent.

On top of this, we have seen a ruthless number of attack from the successive liberal governments to privatise the energy sector, making it even weaker on term of ""attack"" in the context of the world economics. Overall bad publicity, cancellation of major research projects (ASTRID). Some bad managers and a few scandals(Areva, Uramin, finnish reactor build) finished to tarnish the board. Note that the move from GE to buy Alstom with shady man≈ìuvres finished the definitely weakened the whole edifice.

Now that makes also nuclear energy back to the front of discussion, because of the low carbon aspect and the climate change as well as sovereignty issues. Proof is: a lot of people now starts to advocate to use nuclear energy and rejuvenate the historical choices. Macron and its government is rebuying Alstom from GE (while ironically, he was in the charge of the deal while minister of economy in the previous government), as it is a strategic asset. The french academy realised a report advising for nuclear energy use. And almost anyone a bit serious/realistic on the subject will tell you that we cannot do without. Also, the various nuclear-related boards have been warning that if France is not making a roadmap and acting in the 5 years, we are going to be pretty screwed on many fronts as our reactors are getting olders and you dont build new ones overnight. 

Some numbers to convince you about what we are talking about: the french civil nuclear programme from the 70s is about 300billions euros (inflation corrected) and generated 80+% of our electricity with spare to sell in neighbouring countries, and stable, cheap electricity (and quite a few jobs/skills). For the same amount of money, Germany has put a small fraction (do not know the exact figure, but about 10%) of their energy needs in renewables... (exiting also nuclear and reopening a large number of coal plants... And ironically before that, pointing at the french saying naughty, but buying our electricity when needed...). Even more ironically, EU just released a statement saying that nuclear is not classified as green energy, but gas, under certain conditions, can. You can see for yourself here how the german lobbying has been stronger than the french one... This is a bit of a problem as it means for France that it will not be able to count on EU money to further fund a nuclear programme...

That being all said, i am pretty sure this is going to be a major discussion point during the presidential elections next year (or at least i hope) because the decision will shape the future of France for the next half a century. Exciting times! So a hot topic and very dividing, but mainly by dogmatism, not by realism. Just a further note on this, the communist party (very minor these days) is probably the only one stating openly that we need to keep going nuclear for now.

In summary, two minorities (a vocal one against it and a silent one who understands the absolute need for it) and a vast majority completely uneducated of the big picture and what that entails. 

Thanks for the patience reading the long message :)"
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"It's only a guess.  
But i think that the incoming winter will changed a lot of minds in Europe about nuclear energy.  
  
We have every ingredients for a disaster  , exploding gas prices , underperformance of renewables energy , biomass and coal shortage because China is buying everything they can to maintain their own energy grid , exploding electricity price , and all of that just before the heaters start to turn on in Europe.  
And many neighboring countries of France count on it to export electricity , but this year we are one nuclear power plant short ( closed down to please the green party ).  


For quite some time, people in France have been lobbying to shut down all the nuclear power plants and go like Germany ( wind farm / coal / gas plant ) , we will see if they are the same number after this winter."
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"It's more and more accepted as the only reasonable solution (and Germany with its goal/gaz debacle is a good example of what NOT to do).

Except by a group of morons called ecologists, who strongly oppose nuclear energy because those people are for most of them late boomers and new-age ideologists who favor beliefs to science."
Sentiment toward Nuclear Energy,"today in france, nuclear provides electricity: low carbon, reliable, inexpensive.  For me, this remains one of the most effective ways to deal with climate emergencies. We are lucky in France to inherit the nuclear park today !"

France‚Äôs nuclear love affair shows signs of souring,"There are several interesting things in this article, despite some confusion.

>France gets three quarters of its energy generation from nuclear energy. 

*electricity* generation. Electricity is only 1/5 of the total amount of energy used in France, or even less considering the energy used elsewhere to manufacture imported goods.

>President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to reduce nuclear output to 50% of France‚Äôs power mix in 2035 by shutting down 14 aging reactors to make room for renewables. 

It is of course more complicated than that. The president of France does not have the executive nor legislative power to decide something like that. Rather, the Parliamement passed a law that *postponed* to 2035 the goal of 2025 initially set by a law voted by the previous parliament in 2015.


>Electricite de France SA‚Äôs announcement that some of its nuclear reactors at home may contain substandard components

References to this *announcement* would be welcome. I am not aware of such a thing.

>In 2016, its main supplier Framatome disclosed anomalies in manufacturing records for large equipment, leading to prolonged halts at almost a third of the utility‚Äôs reactors. 

One third of three quaters means that France would have lost 25% of it electricity generation. This, of course, did not happen. 

>Even as the price of electricity stemming from wind and solar has sunk below that of new nuclear builds

This seems to be quite a cheap statement indeed, considering the complexities of the European market for wholesale electricity, and the specifics of renewables, whose production is unpredictible and cannot be stored. Add to this the specificities of the *French* electricity market, where nuclear reactors are designed and runned to effectively follow the load and where intermittent renewables can only exist as redundant capacities adding  costs and absolutely no benefits, either finance-wise or climate-wise.

##Nevertheless##

the article ends, at last, with two correct statements

>100% renewable electricity system seems likely to remain out of reach for at least several decades.

Indeed. And ""at least several decades"" may be optimistic, considering that those *100%* entails grid-scale mass storage which would entail ground-breaking scientific discoveries.

> EDF struggles to fund the billions of euros needed each year to maintain its nuclear plants and build new ones within existing cash flows.

Here be dragons.

While the *maintenance* of the currently operating plants up to the point where they recoup the intitial invesments does not seem to be a problem, financing *new ones* on *existing cash flow* only would indeed be quite a challenge. This beeing said, I don't think that many national, strategic, public-service infrastructures are built only by reinvesting the cash flow. It seems plausible that building a large number of new atomic reactors will entail billions of euros of fresh capital. This could be done in two equally problematic ways. The first one would be to call for *private* investment, the second *public* investment.

Private investment faces, at least, two hurdles. The first one is that diluting the state's stake in EDF would be met by opposition from trade unions, some political parties, and possibly by a large chunk of the general population. The second is that, in nuclear industry, the return on investment takes decades to materialize.

Public investment could come from the following, uneasy sources : inflation, more taxes, debt, or divesting from other public investments or services.

French Nuclear Power,"Nuclear has its flaws but electricity production in France has been virtually free of coal and fuel since the 80's. When the Kyoto Protocol was ratified, France's greenhouse gas production was already so low that its target was virtually zero. The side effect may have been that France was less involved into renewable energy and related technology.

[The 2017's French electricity related GG production was basically the same than for the last 30 years](https://youtu.be/G6EOoC_kKI0).

French Nuclear Power,"I'm no specialist within this field but I got my opinion on it.

I think Nuclear Fission as it is now is a good transition energy. Meaning on the long term we would hopefully get rid of it. I hope that through nuclear research we would one day master nuclear fusion and thus having nuclear power without most of its downsides, it could also help the development of renewable energy. 

But if I had to protest against it, my main argument would be: Areva aka Orano. 

Those pieces of shit (beg you pardon for the term but it's in the french tradition to have at least one swear word in your sentence, can't help it) are partially responsible for the instability of Africa and they are putting on peril our relations with the African countries. There are numerous scandals over african communities being removed from their home to allow Areva to mine for Uranium, but no one seems to bat an eye; most likely because of the corruption this company is already known for. It feels disgusting that what I consider to be the future of clean energy is in the hands of this company. "

"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.",Australians take note!  Maybe we will build our nuclear plants and not need to fire them up.
"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.",Nuclear power plants can not be shut down just like that. That is misleading. You can only stop the turbine but then the chain reaction will still continue. That energy has to go somewhere so you have to cool a lot with water and control rods. It's not a on and off switch..it takes weeks to actually shut it down.
"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.",This again. Who is it on Reddit who uses negative prices as a scare tactic on a weekly basis?
"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.","So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

First, reactors can be shut down almost instantaneously. This is for safety. They do keep producing about 8% of their heat though after shut down for about a day. This is removed by, usually, just bleeding steam to the turbine generators, but there are backup methods to this, again, for safety.

A small-ish portion of a nuclear power plant's daily operating cost comes from fuel consumption. A huge portion of the daily operating cost for fossil fuel plants come from fuel consumption. So it's not very cost effective to shut down a nuclear reactor.

As for how long it takes to start up and shut down nuclear plants, it does take awhile if you want to avoid emergency methods. But this is something that was designed in to allow the plants to operate with lower enrichment and large size. If you have a plant designed differently, like with a smaller size, this allows rapid changes in load. Rapid changes in load may become more desired now that renewables are a wide-scale thing. This allows nuclear plants to quickly adapt to changing demand profiles caused by wind and solar variations while still keeping energy green.

Basically, small size nuclear plants are a green solution to make up for the gaps needed to be filled by changing renewable power production.

As for the excess power produced. France just needs to invite companies in that have needs for energy but can take advantage of low grid demand. For example, turning seawater into pure water is energy intensive, but you could only switch those on during peak solar hours. Same thing for producing H2 and O2 gas from H2O. Same thing for producing cryogenic liquids. Same thing for smelting metals (although, I'm not 100% sure about that one). Basically, there are lots of industries that can now pop up in France to take advantage of this negative energy cost."

Germany‚Äôs confounding climate move to opt for coal over nuclear power,"It really isn't confounding at all and Bryan Walsh might know the reasons why if he actually did some investigation.

Precious little space has been given to the detailed reasons *why* the German government is going down this path but there is one quote which alludes to why this is happening;

>‚ÄúThe gas storage tanks must be full by winter,‚Äù Robert Habeck, Germany‚Äôs economy minister and a member of the Green Party, said in June. ‚ÄúThat is our top priority.‚Äù

The plan here is to quickly recommission some coal-fired power plants to temporarily take over from gas-fired plants so that the gas can be used for heating.

The key words there being 'quickly' and 'temporary'. 

You don't just pop down to the local nuclear reactors and mash the ""on"" switch but you can much more quickly get a coal plant up and running. Important when you have a very hard deadline approaching. They can't wait years to get nuclear plants running for a problem which is already happening (gas supplies from the Nord are already off).

The other aspect is 'temporary'. This is just to take load off the operating gas power plants to get through winter and the desire is to shut them off just as quickly. Easy with coal.

Also worth considering the amounts of energy we are discussing. 

Energy from operating gas plants contribute around 89.0 bilion kWh / year (15% of gross energy production). A fair bit greater than the 69.0b kWh from nuclear but a *fraction* of the 236.7b kWh from renewables.

Nobody likes coal, coal is the worst. But in this extreme case the options are limited and coal is sadly the most viable option right now - but it isn't the only option.

What doesn't get reported in low-rate articles like this is that Germany has also brought forward their renewable target of 100% by 2035, and all onshore renewables capacity targets for 2030 have been increased (Nov 2021, ""Easter Package"").  


So in addition to the hard choice of coal to take over from gas they are also deploying as much renewables as possible to accelerate a carbon neutral future."

So its not confusing,  its just disappointing"

France Faces ‚ÄòSubstantial‚Äô Costs If Renewables Wipe Out Nuclear,"[1]

(Bloomberg) -- France faces ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù costs and technical challenges if it wants to replace almost all its aging nuclear plants with renewable energy by 2050, the International Energy Agency and the country‚Äôs grid operator said Wednesday.

In a report commissioned by the French government, the IEA and Reseau de Transport d‚ÄôElectricite highlight the need to scale up new technologies and adapt the legal framework to ensure that a network dominated by variable wind and solar generation remains reliable at all times.

The government is targeting a power mix that‚Äôs about 35% wind and solar in 2035, up from about 10% last year. While the grid can cope with that, France will need more backup production and energy storage if that share is going to expand much further, the report showed. The country must also consider potential public opposition to large wind and solar farms and new power lines.

‚ÄúAll the costs associated with a high share of renewables, including the costs of storage, demand-side flexibility‚Äù and grid development, ‚Äúmight be substantial in France after 2035,‚Äù the IEA and RTE said in the report.

State-controlled Electricite de France SA currently has 56 nuclear power stations in operation, with a production capacity of 61 gigawatts, typically producing almost three-quarters of the country‚Äôs output. It plans to shut a dozen plants by 2035, and most of the rest by 2050.

While President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of building new reactors to replace some of those retiring, he has deferred a decision until after 2022‚Äôs presidential election. Some opposition parties, such as the Greens, are against new atomic plants, pointing to rising costs at EDF‚Äôs current nuclear projects in France and the U.K., as well as environmental risks associated with operating the the generators and storing spent fuel."
France Faces ‚ÄòSubstantial‚Äô Costs If Renewables Wipe Out Nuclear,France has an electricity deficit in the winter and surpluses in the summer due to all the nuclear that they have. They import/export electricity from other EU countries to accommodate the different demand side v the steady domestic supply side. The EU should build out the European HVDC network to further balance supply and demand across Europe.
Nuclear Power might be considered a renewable energy source in Arizona,"Renewable may not be the entirely correct term, but certainly it deserves the label ""green"" and we should be using a lot more of it. Good on Arizona for being so progressive."
Why France is eyeing nuclear power again,"I know nuclear power is a popular meme on reddit, but there is a reason its being abandoned globally; its that it is expensive and does not offer anything over renewable energy

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618300598

""Contrary to a persistent myth based on erroneous methods, global data show that renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear power does or ever has.""

It is also not remotely economical, as of the latest LCOE (levelized cost of energy) nuclear is over 3x more expensive than wind and solar. This means a given dollar figure of investment will give 3x as much decarbonization if invested into wind and solar instead of nuclear.

https://www.lazard.com/media/450436/rehcd3.jpg

Nuclear has never even been economically viable, it is never been done, anywhere without massive government support:

""Most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world, where there is a competitive market for electricity, has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated. Only where the government or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered.""

renewables are subsidized less:

https://htpr.cnet.com/p/?u=http://i.bnet.com/blogs/subsidies-2.bmp&h=Y8-1SgM_eMRp5d2VOBmNBw

And after all the subsidies nuclear has received, it is still not viable without subsidies, meanwhile wind and solar have many examples of subsidy-free projects

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/subsidy-free-solar-comes-to-the-uk

With the overall lower subsidies to the renewables industry, they have transitioned to being viable without in a very short period of time, compared to nukes which literally remain subsidy junkies 50 years after their first suckle at the government teat.

Renewables even make better use of subsidy dollars; the same amount of subsidy invested in renewables vs nuclear will give many times more energy as a result.

""Global reported investment for the construction of the four commercial nuclear reactor projects (excluding the demonstration CFR-600 in China) started in 2017 is nearly US$16 billion for about 4 GW. This compares to US$280 billion renewable energy investment, including over US$100 billion in wind power and US$160 billion in solar photovoltaics (PV). China alone invested US$126 billion, over 40 times as much as in 2004. Mexico and Sweden enter the Top-Ten investors for the first time. A significant boost to renewables investment was also given in Australia (x 1.6) and Mexico (x 9). Global investment decisions on new commercial nuclear power plants of about US$16 billion remain a factor of 8 below the investments in renewables in China alone. ""

""The economic history and financial analyses carried out at DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been unprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in the future. Between 1951 and 2017, none of the 674 nuclear reactors built was done so with private capital under competitive conditions. Large state subsidies were used in the cases where private capital flowed into financing the nuclear industry. The post-war period did not witness a transition from the military nuclear industry to commercial use, and the boom in state-financed nuclear power plants soon fizzled out in the 1960s. Financial investment calculations confirmed the trend: investing in a new nuclear power plant leads to average losses of around five billion euros.""

The results of this is that in 2017 there was over 150 GW of wind and solar coming online, but nuclear:

""New nuclear capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 was outweighed by lost capacity of 4.6 GW.""

Renewable energy is doing more for decarbonization than nuclear.

Now the inevitable response is ""muh storage"" but

Renewables+ compressed air storage is already cheaper than nuclear

https://www.rechargenews.com/transition/1821297/liquid-air-storage-offers-cheapest-route-to-24-hour-wind-and-solar

""‚ÄúFor a 100MW system, we are already touching [a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of] $100 per MWh today,‚Äù chief executive Javier Cavada tells Recharge. ‚ÄúIn ten years from now, I can see that being $50/MWh. That's very doable.‚Äù

By comparison, a new pumped-hydro plant would have an LCOS of $152-198 per MWh, with a comparable lithium-ion system costing $285-581/MWh, according to analyst Lazard.

With a new gas-peaker plant having a levelized cost of energy of $156-210/MWh, and wind power at $30-60/MWh (according to Lazard), it may already cheaper to balance the grid using wind-powered liquid-air storage than fossil-fuel technology. And if the LAES system is ‚Äúcharged‚Äù using wind power that would otherwise be curtailed, the wholesale price of that power would be close to zero.""

So we already have renewable+storage that is cheaper than nuclear.

Nuclear does not even work as a compliment to renewable energy.

It is a myth that a baseload generator like nuclear, ie something that makes a continuous output, is needed with VRE (variable renewable energy).

What you need is something capable of quick ramping up to fill in the gaps when no sun or wind. (batteries, Hydrogen, gas)

Nuclear is already expensive, and if wind and solar are cheaper 50% of the day (when there is wind or solar essentially), that means one would only need nuclear to provide ""baseload"" 50% of the time.

Except nuclear price is made up of initial capex more than fuel costs, so turning off a nuclear plant for when it is needed does not save money. What it means is it now has only 50% of the time to make the same money as before, so the price now doubles to the customer. Which is why nuclear will never fill the gaps in renewable energy, it is already expensive, and will only get more expensive the more renewables come online

Nuclear is a square peg for the round holes in the future energy grid.

Its decline will continue

Why France is eyeing nuclear power again,"\>  [Some were still surprised](https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1184529090604392448?s=20) that France is forging ahead with large EPR reactors instead of [small, modular ones](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608271/small-reactors-could-kick-start-the-stalled-nuclear-sector/) that might significantly cut up-front costs and development risks.  
But Lovering and [others noted](https://twitter.com/PROUSTEric1/status/1184221759685439488?s=20) that with the first EPR plants coming online, the industry has developed expertise, supply chains, and design refinements that should help cut costs and reduce the time it takes to develop subsequent reactors.

The title is misleading, in that it makes it seem as if it is somehow too hot for the nuclear plants to operate, or that there is some nuclear reactor safety issue.  The problem is actually with nuclear plants along shallow rivers that don't have cooling towers and other technologies in place to cool water as it **exits** the plant and reenters  these rivers.  As a result, during strong heat-waves, the water has not been cooled to a temperature sufficient to meet environmental regulations.  Therefore the plants must be shut down.

2.  Just because it is not the whole solution does not mean it cannot be part of the solution.
3,4.  The best argument, but still, if you consider the full cost of coal, including pollution, nuclear is more competitive.  While renewable sources may be more cost effected, they run into your #2 big time -- which is why we need a comprehensive solution including wind, solar, and nuclear.
5.  Storing nuclear waste is not that hard, it is much easier and less harmful to the environment then storing coal waste.
6.  I'm not convinced, more uranium will likely be found.  42 years is a long time, by then we may have Thorium reactors, economically viable seawater extraction, or something else.
7.  It is far safer than the coal plants they would replace.  I am not convinced they are inherently unsafe -- they have gotten safer over the years -- a modern plant has never killed anyone.
8.  Not really a relevant argument in the first world
9,10,11,12.  All of these problems are either even or far worse with coal.
13.  Nuclear power in the first world in no way detracts from wind power in the 3rd world.

In summary, the OP's analysis fails to compare nuclear with the coal plants it would supplant.  I too prefer wind and solar, but they can only grow so fast and have problems dealing with base demand.  Nuclear is an excellent complement.  "
"I'm anti-nuclear, because these are the only arguments I know. Please enlighten me on the ""pro"" position.","I definitely *wouldn't* rule out nuclear as an option for future energy generation.

The best argument I've heard suggests that nuclear capacity should be maintained at its current rate. In other words, new nuclear reactors should only be built to replace old reactors that close down. This should help maintain uranium reserves, although as the supply of uranium becomes less plentiful and harder to extract the cost of using it will go up. It also should help finding suitable sites for new stations, since in many cases they can be built in the same location as the reactor they're due to replace.

Most of the problems with nuclear - safety risks, waste disposal, construction over-runs - are engineering problems that have known solutions. Unfortunately, these solutions don't come cheap. However, putting in place a suitable renewable energy network that can handle baseload demand could be similarly expensive. Nuclear generation will benefit from the rising cost of carbon (just as renewables will) and may be a more attractive option in the next few years.

In the UK, the Scottish parliament has ruled out building any new nuclear reactors. This makes sense, since Scotland has ample opportunity for wind, wave and tidal energy generation. A big majority of the UK's renewable energy targets are likely to come from Scotland. The south of the country is less fortunate, and it also happens to be where energy demand is highest. Siting new nuclear stations close to areas of high demand will mean fewer transmission losses. Unfortunately, that means more additional costs due to the higher land value.

A few caveats. Before any new nuclear reactors are built, a thorough study should be done of all the costs (and emissions) involved over the entire life cycle of the plant, especially with regards to decomissioning old reactors. This will allow a fair and honest comparison to be made between nuclear power and the alternatives. Plans should be in place for suitable disposal of waste - most of the UKs nuclear waste is still in temporary storage waiting permanent storage in a facility that has yet to get off the drawing board, which is a disgrace.

Although I'd put wind, solar, hydro and tidal energy before nuclear given the choice, I've a feeling that the shift in thinking to enable our emissions targets to be met will be too much to rely on renewables alone. Even though you're not looking to make the comparison with coal power, there may not turn out to be much choice.

"European Parliament backs listing nuclear energy, gas as 'green' in narrow vote","For all of you that cannot comprehend why gas is now seen as green I will try to explain.

For any energy system based on renewables there is inherent intermittency in energy production. The way our current energy system is set up, demand and supply need to be matched at all times in order to avoid wide scale outages. In order to mitigate the intermittency, we need energy generation that is easy to ramp production up or down, for example nuclear or gas. In essence you could use other ""burnable"" energy carriers, e.g. hydrogen, but those are still produced from natural gas, so that will only ensure efficiency losses.

Now long term nuclear is a very good option to perform this task, however, there is nearly not enough nuclear capacity in Europe to cover all of the variability, thus we need some other source. For this purpose, gas is the best option as of now.

So why name it green, well that's just a policy decision, to make it possible to keep investing in gas based power generation. No one actually believes gas is green.

TLDR; gas is not green, but it performs a task that no other green alternative can perform on the same scale and efficiency as gas plants can do, therefore we need them the coming decades."

How much would the equivalent amount of energy cost from other, non-fossil sources? More.

>Where will the funds come from?

Just use a fraction of whatever you were going to devote towards your ludicrous renewables scheme. 

Then build yourself a moon base with the spare change leftover from having gone the nuclear route instead.

>Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute has said for many years that the pursuit of nuclear power will make climate change worse

Remember when I said I couldn't think of anyone less qualified on nuclear energy? I was wrong.

Think hard: Does France's electricity emit more CO2 or does Germany's?

It must irk Mr. Lovins so much that there's continuous, empirical evidence that he's wrong on this point.

>Finding a solution to crippling unemployment is now an urgent matter for many countries.

They had a saying in the old Soviet Union - nobody is unemployed but some buildings have 5 doormen.

Arguing against nuclear by saying it's too economically efficient is ridiculous, especially when you follow it up with an argument that you should pay much more for the same amount of energy to create jobs.

>Nuclear power won't help most countries become energy independent,  because only a handful of nations in the world possess significant uranium resources.

Why would Canada or Australia stop selling uranium? This is just scaremongering.

Renewables like dollar and wind NEED a compliment like nuclear to handle peak load and also to store excess energy in the form of heat as grid battery storage will never be a realistic option with today's technology."
Nuclear energy is wildly uncompetitive without a high price on carbon dioxide emissions,Thank you.  Finally.  The champions of deregulation are always using regulation to twist calculation in their own interest.
Nuclear energy is wildly uncompetitive without a high price on carbon dioxide emissions,"This is very true but a huge amount of that cost is from antiquated and piecemeal regulations set forth by the NRC that balloon expenses astronomically, without any benefit. Safety is critical, of course, but common sense is severely lacking and the regulations need serious updating and streamlining to be practical. 

Small example: we built millions of dollars of assemblies for a nuclear fuel fabrication facility. We had a lot of involvement with auditors and inspectors to be sure everyone was done perfectly. Our suppliers were audited and an extensive paper trail was created to validate the origin and traceability of every component, down to a screw. Every assembly was thoroughly tested and documented - even on video. Every mechanical connection and electrical termination was torqued and recorded no matter how insignificant. So far, no problems with that. But then, when everything was traced, torqued, and tested, they couldn't be used without ""third party validation."" What this means, was that every completed assembly was shipped to a warehouse, every termination was undone, every wire and device removed, and it was completely disassembled. Traceability of each component was confirmed, simply by using the purchase orders and certificates of authenticity they we *already* compiled, without further verification (in other words, if we had forged anything, they'd have no clue anyway). After that they'd have to put everything back together, and hire someone (not us) to torque everything back to the specifications we created (where MFR specs weren't available) and documented already. That ""service"" of undoing and redoing what we'd already done was about 4 times the cost of us engineering and building them in the first place, and took at least 3 times as long (years later they were still asking us questions). And they weren't as skilled or capable as us, so all they did was create problems that didn't exist when we shipped the product. A decade later, the facility isn't operational and the projected cost has increased by billions, if it's ever finished. It could have been completed for a fraction of the cost, just as safely if not moreso because you wouldn't have people taking apart assemblies they aren't qualified to build in the first place."

Nuclear energy is wildly uncompetitive without a high price on carbon dioxide emissions,"I really don't understand why we debate about this at all.  Let's replace every coal power plant with whatever the most cost effective carbon neutral option is.  If it's solar or wind, great, if we need to include Nuclear than we should include Nuclear.  I really don't care what the options are, I want CO2 to stop being produced in order to make energy.  We have a number of options, we can assess each area, solar and wind aren't the best solution for every location.  Let's just use whatever the best solution is in each location.  I really don't understand why we debate about this, every option is better than fossil fuels, let's just replace them however we can."
We desperately need nuclear energy powering mass electric transportation; the Eurostar train is about as carbon-intensive per kilometer as walking,"Admittedly I haven't read through your sources but, out of curiosity, do those figures refer only to the CO2 emissions associated with the running of the trains, presumably so considering how low they are?

Is there any mention in the report about the CO2 emissions associated with the construction of the channel tunnel? For example, the tunnel is, as far as I am aware, constructed almost entirely from precast concrete sections. The production of cement clinker results in a number of effluent, water usage and emission issues, not least a global average production rate of 0.83kg CO2 per 1kg of cement used ([https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/tracking2007SUM.pdf](https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/tracking2007SUM.pdf)). 

For reference, the average structural concrete mix is likely to contain between 14-20% cement (unless cement replacement materials such as PFA are used), with a typical density of concrete of 2400kg/m3 (direct knowledge - I am a qualified and practicing civil engineer). The channel tunnel actually consists of three tunnels, each circa 50km long, two of which are 7.6m in diameter and the service tunnel is 4.8m diameter ([https://www.getlinkgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/](https://www.getlinkgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/)). If we assume a wall thickness of the precast units at 200mm (unverified but a reasonable, if not probably under, estimation) and apply very simple maths, this equates to circa 11,083kg concrete per linear metre i.e. circa 1.6 tonnes CO2 per linear metre of the three tunnels i.e. 78 tonnes CO2 in the concrete for the tunnels alone. In actuality the figure is probably much higher, as the tunnels in reality will be longer than 50km.

This is considering the CO2 impact of the cement element of the concrete alone, there is the quarrying of aggregate for concrete production, plus the transportation and placement of the materials to consider also. Then there is the material used for the engineering fill, the additional cement that was probably used to stabilise and modify the soils for the rail heads etc. (which would likely have been poor due to their geographical location i.e. coastal), let alone the countless other energy hungry materials utilised, the transportation of said construction materials (including the concrete), and the emissions and damage caused by the construction activities, right down to the vans carrying the workmen to and from the site.

I know the channel tunnel was not constructed specifically for Eurostar, so it is something of a skewed example, but it is pertinent to raise the question of how long 'clean' infrastructure takes to offset the emissions associated with its' construction?

This is in no least means a challenge to your post, rather just an additional point that is often overlooked (and not necessarily by yourself). I wholeheartedly agree that transportation, particularly the switch from fossil fuel to (renewably generated) electrically powered mass transportation is essential to stem the tide of associated CO2 and other transport related emissions, but we need to ensure that we make the best use of the infrastructure we already have, rather than creating enormous civil engineering projects, complete with their associated emissions that would take the cleanest of technologies decades to offset."
We desperately need nuclear energy powering mass electric transportation; the Eurostar train is about as carbon-intensive per kilometer as walking,"I agree with your point and I was concerned about the nuclear waste generated by reactors. But, I changed my view after I attended a talk about 'Molten Salt Reactor - MSR' by Seaborg technologies CEO Troels sch√∂nfeld.

Basically, they have made / conceptualised a way of making MSR smaller, safer and cheaper than conventional nuclear reactors. By doing this, they hope to capture a part of the market for energy production by making it competitive / cheaper than coal production by 2025.

The cherry on top is that they want to process nuclear waste. This is from their website: "" In the CMSR (Compact Molten Salt Reactor), the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant. This provides significant safety benefits.

If the fuel salt should ever come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and turn into solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself.

The reactor will operate at near-atmospheric pressures and cannot overheat due to a frozen salt plug, that melt and drain the core to cooled tanks before damage can occur.""

So, all in all, I agree with you and I hope this nuclear technology alongwith others makes fossil fuels obsolete."

"Many people are using the Ukraine conflict as an example of why nuclear generated electricity is dangerous, but that misses the bigger picture about how fossil fuels kill millions each year, while nuclear barely kills any","Another opinion I'm really disappointed in how many ppl support, is that many politicians are using the Ukraine conflict to say that fossil fuel production needs to increase so that there is a domestic supply instead of relying on another country which wouldn't be apply to supply in times of war. 

However, that's the wrong approach. In order to prevent dependency on another country's fossil fuel supply, the best solution is not to increase your own country's fossil fuel production, it is to reduce fossil fuel use, period. There is no need to tap into domestic fossil fuel or foreign fossil fuel if there is no need for it in the first place."
"Many people are using the Ukraine conflict as an example of why nuclear generated electricity is dangerous, but that misses the bigger picture about how fossil fuels kill millions each year, while nuclear barely kills any","I always send people the Kyle Hill video about nuclear power.

"Many people are using the Ukraine conflict as an example of why nuclear generated electricity is dangerous, but that misses the bigger picture about how fossil fuels kill millions each year, while nuclear barely kills any",I understand what you're saying.

"I see a lot of posts on alternative energy, but I haven't seen a lot on Nuclear.","Yes, nuclear contributes much less to global warming than fossil fuels. There are two main issues with it:

1. Modern plants built in non-seismically active places are very safe. But they are safe because they are designed with an enormous amount of security and safeguards. As a result, they are expensive to build and take a long time to build and plan.

2. Nuclear waste is still a thing. Nuclear plants generate a lot of low level nuclear waste and a small amount of high level nuclear waste, some of which can have half-lives in the millions of years. There are a lot of ideas for getting rid of this waste, but the first long term disposal facilities are just starting to come online and they amount to ‚ÄúDig a really deep hole, fill it with spent fuel rods, and close it up and don‚Äôt dig there for another million years.‚Äù Most nuclear waste today is stored in big metal drums out behind the nuclear plant.

Tl;dr: renewables can be built faster and cheaper than nuclear, and don‚Äôt generate deadly waste streams that we‚Äôll have to deal with for hundreds of thousands of years."
"I see a lot of posts on alternative energy, but I haven't seen a lot on Nuclear.","'More efficient in every aspect', what are you even measuring as 'efficiency' here?

It's more efficient per land used, that's true. Although vs. on-shore wind in terms of direct land use, not by much.

It's less efficient by pretty much every aspect of 'economic effort needed to produce 1 MWh of power'."
"I see a lot of posts on alternative energy, but I haven't seen a lot on Nuclear.","As a general rule, assuming that we've solved human error is a bad idea.

"I see a lot of posts on alternative energy, but I haven't seen a lot on Nuclear.","It‚Äôs essentially out of fashion.

"I see a lot of posts on alternative energy, but I haven't seen a lot on Nuclear.","I think it's quite the opposite, we see a lot of content about nuclear compared to what it can actually achieve.   

Yes, it's a really good source of energy: low carbon emission, low land use, stable production. However, it's really slow to develop, high upfront cost, high technological skills required. In the end, IAEA (united nation agency that promotes nuclear worldwide) estimates that there will be no more than 12% of nuclear in the electric mix worldwide, and it's extremely optimistic.   
If you check scenarios from the IPCC or IEA, you'll see that nuclear is expected to deliver a really small % of power compared to renewables (mainly solar and wind for electricity and biomass for the rest).  

It's not because it's a bad source of energy, it's because it's hard to scale up.  Drawback of nuclear and renewable are massively overestimated, and it's pointless to oppose both."

However, I'm not optimistic about it playing a large role after that in it's current form, with the way the grid is going.

However, new nuclear isn't being built because of the prohibitive cost for construction and operation, any how long it takes to build new plants. 

There's a lot of other discussion about the changing grid and demand patterns, but long story short, nuclear just isn't meant to play in the spaces that are going to be the norm going forward. I can elaborate on this further when I'm out of this conference later today.

If a nuclear plant fails, the results are devastating; in the US, taxpayers insure nuke liability, not plant owners, because the liability is massive.  People build and run nuke plants; people make errors.  Nuclear power is deeply enmeshed with nuclear weapons programs.  

Nope."
Nuclear energy,"I spent my career working in nuclear power and would like to respond to these comments but separately if possible. My background and expertise is radiation safety. 

Why do you say plants built in the 70/80s suck? To remain in operation they are constantly updating and if they cannot meet current safety requirements they won‚Äôt be allowed to operate through the end of their license to operate. 

The computer in our pocket would have done nothing to mitigate Chernobyl which resulted from plant staff deliberately circumventing safety systems to see how the plant would react to a condition that relied on turbine driven safety systems which are not primary for that purpose and when they realized they had an overheating core dumped cold water in that resulted in a steam and chemical reaction, not nuclear, that blew the lid off 

TMI wouldn‚Äôt have happened if operating staff hadn‚Äôt shut off a safety system because they had not been properly trained and plant instruments suggested a different issue. 

Currently the REGinna NPP near Rochester, NY, is the oldest in the country (>40 years operating) operating safely 

The cost to build has always been an issue but many problems didn‚Äôt arise from bad designs but from poorly constructed things. Early in my career, for example, plants were required to perform inspections on hangars used to support safety related systems. What happened was when drilling into rebar reinforced concrete the drill would not advance the depth required by the design and pipe fitters would cut off the end to not need to drill a new hole and fix the one in the wrong places. Shortened anchors didn‚Äôt meet specifications and plants were down until they were fixed. Not bad design but construction quality control was the issue. There are many instances I could convey. 

So the public only hears plants are down (unreliable) without understanding the real issue which is companies trying to compete in spite of not being spec. (Catch me if you can)

France Nationalized nuclear power and the US Navy doesn‚Äôt have the budget constraints commercial plants have so it‚Äôs a good comparison. 

And as to our expertise. Very few US companies have recent experience and staff in USA but training, education and staffing is far easier than fabrication of key components. Need a new reactor head? Probably a few years from ordering to delivery. 

Please feel free to ask questions. 

What‚Äôs the perverse incentives issue?"
Nuclear energy,"Actually there are some pretty good nuclear plants that have been running for like half a century in the US. You could just build the same freaking design and be fine. Of course you could also add 50 years of experience in engineering and add some passive safety, but safety is not the reason they are not build.

Every MW of nuclear in the US takes like 6.000 usd to build. In South Korea is less than 2.500 usd/MW

The thing in the US is that nuclear evolved in a era where energy utilities where paid fixed return over their costs, both operational and investments. This made some incentives to first not run plants in the most efficient way but also it meant that the costlier your investment, the bigger return you could get. So building nuclear became a headache because that was the way to maximize your utilities.

Also, nuclear lags against renewables in how easy it is to finance the latter. Even a household can pay a few solar panels, and you can scale it to the size of any pocket. Nuclear can only be built by massive companies with state backing and assurances. This plus the fact US energy market doesn't have the interest to fix the perverse incentives issue facing nuclear means its not going to go anywhere as fast as its needed to make a dent in the climate change issue. I could be wrong, if tomorrow everyone wakes up loving nuclear and you lift a rock and find 10.000 nuclear engineers ready to make the nuclear renaissance it could happen and could make sense, but also you have to consider that nuclear by itself is also not a great match for renewables as its not great at following variable of wind and solar"
Nuclear energy,"1- The US isn‚Äôt lagging behind Europe on nuclear. Nuclear power in Europe is, much like nuclear power in the US, almost completely stagnant with almost no new development. You may be thinking of France, famous for ubiquitous nuclear power‚Ä¶but France hasn‚Äôt built a new nuclear power plant in a couple of decades, and only has one new reactor in construction: Flamanville 3, which was supposed to enter operation in 2012 but is now 12 years late (oh, and it‚Äôs currently estimated to cost ‚Ç¨19.1 billion, compared to the original budgeted ‚Ç¨3.3 billion). Germany is decommissioning their entire fleet. England only has four operating plants left, three of which are shutting down this decade and only one new one under construction (which is late and has already massively outstripped its budget). Elsewhere in Europe, the only recently opened nuclear reactor is Olkiluoto 3 in Finland, which entered operation this year‚Ä¶fourteen years past schedule. There was a Olkiluoto 4 planned, but after a decade of work on 3 they scrapped that idea. Poland swears they‚Äôre going to build a whole fleet of plants over the next decade, but given that they‚Äôve never built a single plant before I wouldn‚Äôt put too much stock in that.

2-Nuclear plants built in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs ranged from criminally bad (RBMK-1000) to perfectly adequate, if a bit archaic by modern standards. Modern Gen III reactors are definitely safer, but the big problem with them is that they‚Äôre hellishly expensive and difficult to build.

3-Nuclear waste triggers deep and visceral reactions in people. Rational or not, you can‚Äôt hand wave it away‚Äîjust look at Yucca Mountain, which has been abandoned as a potential nuclear waste repository because of deep-seated opposition from Nevadans.

4-Because it‚Äôs expensive, slow to build, difficult to site, and faces intense public opposition. Meanwhile wind, solar, and grid-scale battery installations are sustainable, easy to build, and much, much cheaper. 

5-Photovoltaics *are* recyclable. But yes, we will predominantly be powering a global zero emission EV fleet from wind and solar. If you want to power a global fleet of EV‚Äôs with nuclear power then step one would be to build a time machine because there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs happening today.

6-Curious that you didn‚Äôt mention Fukushima, which was only 12 years ago.

Reddit loves to crow on about nuclear, but the fact is it‚Äôs a dying technology that makes zero economic sense and isn‚Äôt a viable solution to climate change because it cannot be built in a time scale relevant to the problem."
Nuclear energy,"I think that the biggest issues have to do with funding (the US military still gets most of the tax dollars), [figuring out what to do about long term storage of radioactive waste](https://youtu.be/ZwY2E0hjGuU?si=JgWFOCp7_Pl5Fdzg) (I‚Äôm talking 240,000 years‚Ä¶ not decades) and the safety issues. More recent issues were with Fukushima (2011) and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine (2022-now). 

Don‚Äôt forget, there are real repercussions to these fuck ups. I‚Äôm pretty sure that will never be able to eat wild boars in Germany because of what happened in Chernobyl.

Spending time in one industry learning the process and the business is not the current employment strategy for people below the age of 40.

Nuclear is even worse, read the comments, look at the excuses, the scare tactics, where will they build it?  It used to be could build it in an impoverished area needing jobs, with all the remote workers out there moving to these areas they will attempt to stop it.  The NIMBY‚Äôs live everywhere. Even if one is built where will the fuel come from, they will stop the mining.

Nuclear energy,"Until we can create a stable regulatory environment and remove the ability of every Tom, Dick and Harry to file lawsuits along every step of the building process, we don‚Äôt be able to build more at a reasonable price.

Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"Nuclear is very safe to handle and has a high energy output. Storing the waste is also safe. The main issue is that it also functions on a finite resource as its source of energy which also has to be refined, transported and stored. That is fission and could be a great bridge to go full sustainable.

If we are able to achieve commercial fusion it could be a great addition to our energy grid but we still have to see about that. I am hopeful though. 

So in total, a positive image is justified because nuclear is practical."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"I kind of chuckled at the idea of ""tech bros"" having anything to do with the positive image of nuclear.  Nuclear energy (the industry,  the safety culture, etc) is the absolute antithesis of tech bro culture. 

Nuclear energy has been maligned for decades - we've been fed tons of anti-nuclear propaganda for ages.   The difference now is that people have finally started figuring out that nuclear power is not the boogie man that they were led to believe it was and that its an important part of our power mix and very necessary if we are going to fight climate change.  Renewable energy sources are also important.  We need both."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"There has never been a radiological accident at a plant that had passed, or would have passed,  NRC scrutiny.

There are more deaths and injuries, per unit of energy produced, in wind power than nuclear power. 

Spent fuel is metallic or ceramic pellets...there is no oozing green liquid.

Nuclear has provided 20% of US power for decades. All of the spent fuel from that entire history would fit in a Walmart.

The amount of nuclear fuel required to provide an average American with a lifetime supply of energy is the size of a soda can.

There has never been a death, injury, or, as far as I know, any actual ecological impact from spent fuel. (Fuel for weapons in another matter, but also entirely different)

You can hug a dry cask (used to store spent fuel) and not receive any significant radiation. The casks can survive being hit by a train.

Nuclear is cost competitive with wind and solar when including all factors:
-The energy storage required when there is no fossil fuel power
-The capacity factor (over 90% for nuclear)
-Lifespan (nuclear plants are designed for 80 years with a recertification at 40)

It does have a higher upfront cost, though, which capitalism struggles with.

Nuclear requires by far the fewest raw materials of any power source. Raw materials will be a limiting factor in how quickly we can deploy carbon free power."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"Nuclear power is great. 

But... It's incredibly expensive. It's a top-down, big money solution to energy sustainability that entrenches the power of the handful of big energy companies that are able to afford to be in the nuclear power industry. 

Solar power, anyone can put on their roof. Any small business start-up can afford to get into wind generation.  And the output of those is now cheaper electricity than that generated with nuclear power. 

Increasing the efficiency of power useage, and increasing small scale renewable energy is the bottom-up solution that I'm more in favor of.  A solution that helps people become energy independent, rather than helping giant corporations capture a market."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"Downscaling our energy demand as part of a post-growth economy is the only truly ""sustainable"" solution. Nuclear, solar and wind are no different from fossil fuels if we have the same extractive mindset where humans exploit nature to achieve GDP growth to make the 1% richer."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,Just look up deaths per terawatt hour. More people have died from wind power if you look at it this way.
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"Nuclear should be part of our energy mix but the techno optimists who claim it is our salvation are ignoring some pretty important points:
-The energy return on energy invested (EROI) for nuclear is generally accepted as being between 5:1 and 15:1. This will mean much less surplus energy available than current fossil fuels.
-The low energy return on energy invested is because it requires a large amount of energy to mine uranium and then a low of concrete and other materials to build the plants.
-It takes at least 15 years to build a new nuclear power plant so will take to long to implement as a solution to decarbonise n the next 20-30 years.
-It requires uranium which is a finite resource. Estimates are that we only have 70 years of uranium left at current consumption rates.
-It requires large amounts of water. Already climate change is causing issues with droughts meaning there is not enough water available in rivers for cooling or in areas where there are heatwaves the water is too hot to use for cooling."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"From everything I have read, retaining our existing nuclear is a reasonable path (speaking for the US here) but building more is much less cost effective than scaling up wind, water, solar, batteries, transmission and pumped storage. The cost of new nuclear in the US or Europe (that is, well-regulated and hence safe) is really prohibitive. The cost overruns of Hinkley in the UK and Vogtle in the US are emblematic of this problem. In both cases the same capacity could have been obtained at a much lower cost.

There are however some benefits that are not easy to express in pure financial terms. The amount of land taken up by renewables is much higher than nuclear. And when you look at the purposeful environmental ruin of such as Texas's recent legislation which is meant to suppress renewables development, it's clear we need to throw a sop to stupid people with power in state and local governments, and the best option there is nuclear."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"If we ever figure out cold fusions, sure. But there‚Äôs a finite amount of Uranium on earth and the solar system."
Is the positive image of nuclear energy justified?,"Obviously when discussing energy like this the real question is nuclear vs solar and wind, since the goal is to phase out coal/oil, and hydro/geothermal aren't universally applicable.

So on a comparison to both solar and wind, nuclear is safer, has lower net carbon outputs, is more reliable, lasts longer, takes up less space, and notably, is cheaper.

Additionally, and most importantly, the world doesn't have enough base metal reserves to build out even 20 years worth of solar and wind power (and the reserves we do have will not be begun to be mined for at least another 20 years on a best case scenario), but nuclear breeder reactors can sustain the current energy demands of the world quite literally from now until the estimated death of the sun.

So really, there's not a single thing that any other energy source can do better than nuclear. It's the only realistic, long lasting (permanent) solution. Not just for carbon redundant, but for energy needs period."
Discussion: Are you pro or against nuclear energy and why? And if you think the environmental impacts of Nuclear waste are 'worth' it.,"Here is one thing I rarely see in debates. 


Energy is needed for the whole world, not only stable developed countries. Whatever technology gets developed and improved will be used later in developing countries.



Do we really want some countries, will not mention any here, to have nuclear power? I am not even talking about malice,  just incompetence and corruption.




Second, nuclear waste is a problem that is not yet solved and we don't have a real solution. Some people are convinced it is, like some believe plastic is recyclable (my definition of recyclable is that I can recycle a plastic bottle and make the same quality bottle infinite times, that is not the case) . It is not, just dig a bit deeper than marketing sells us."
Discussion: Are you pro or against nuclear energy and why? And if you think the environmental impacts of Nuclear waste are 'worth' it.,">Feel free to have a friendly debate

I think this whole debate is mostly just a distraction. Nuclear power hasn't really contributed anymore to more fossil fuel reduction over the last 30 years.

It was a big hope in the 90s that it would be used to displace coal+gas after it was successfully used to reduce oil consumption in the wake of the oil crisis. But it never came to pass. There simply wasn't sufficient interest by nations to replace domestic coal burning with nuclear power. Instead we saw gas replace some coal and their sum wasn't affected by nuclear roll out.

You can nicely see this in [this graph on primary energy consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-consumption-by-source-and-country):

The share of oil peaked in 1973 at 49.22%. In that year nuclear made up 0.87% and hydro 5.82%. While coal provided for 26.71% and gas for 17.2%.

The oil crises were in 1973 and in 1979. Fifteen years after the first oil crisis, the share of oil had been diminished by around 10% to a level just below 40%.
This was achieved primarily by an increase of nuclear power to 5.8% (~+5 percentage points), an increase in hydro power to 6.7% (~+0.9 percentage point), and a move to coal (~+1.3 percentage points) and gas (~+2.3 percentage points).

At around that point discussions and negotiations on international climate action began leading up to the Kyoto protocol in 1997. Cimate scientists had the hope that the expansion of nuclear power would go on during the nineties and not only replace oil, but also especially coal burning. However this did not happen. Instead oil shares stagnated at more than 39% until 1999 and coal+gas only declined from 47.59% to 46.17%. Nuclear power grew by another 0.9 percentage points and hydro by 0.3 percentage points.

Then there was the Chinese boom with a massive expansion of coal burning giving us an increased share of coal+gas in 2012 of 52.66% at the cost of oil, which fell further to 33.49%, nuclear fell to 4.43% and hydro to 6.81%.

So, in total fossil fuel consumption stagnated between 1990 an 2012 for about 20 years, with neither nuclear, nor hydro providing sufficient means to dent the trend and get at least those share to go into decline.

This only happened after 2012 with the rise of wind+solar power: those made up 1.18% back than. And they rose to 5.33% in 2022, a rise of 4.15 percentage points in ten years. Finally, at least the shares of fossil fuels declined again, and it seems like we found some effective strategy to decrease fossil fuel usage.

Debating about nuclear power feels a little bit like being stuck in the turn of the millenium, after the Kyoto protocol when there was a lot of talk about a nuclear renaissance and high hopes that nuclear power could prove an effective tool to overcome our fossil fuel addiction. Now, twenty years later these hopes still haven't come about. Instead, it turned out that we were able to reduce fossil fuel market shares with the help of new, variable renewable power production. And all indications are that those will get us now also to absolute declines in fossil fuel production.

Now, the debate on nuclear power seems to me to be often utilized to the end to distract from this effective strategy, to belittle renewable power expansion, and trying to slow it down. See, for example, the Australian conservatives that promoted coal while in government and now in the opposition push for nuclear power instead of renewable expansion. You could get the impression that they are only arguing in this way because they rely on the experience that nuclear power would not eat into coal+gas consumption for another 20 years there.

The debate gets differently colored in different places, but all in all it somehow seems to take up a disproportional share of overall discussion, measured by the probable contribution to climate mitigation that it could offer."
Discussion: Are you pro or against nuclear energy and why? And if you think the environmental impacts of Nuclear waste are 'worth' it.,"I'm not sure energy is a pro or con debate. We need energy to survive and unless we can figure out how to use less, all energy can be bad if we have bad actors (take lithium mining for batteries as an example). A look at [nuclear energy](https://www.littlegreenmyths.com/household/nuclear) requires a holistic look at the impacts of the entire nuclear energy life cycle.  

Myth #1: Nuclear Energy is Completely Carbon-Free.  
While nuclear power plants don't directly emit greenhouse gases during operation, their lifecycle does involve some carbon emissions. These occur during mining and refining uranium, construction, and decommissioning facilities. If fossil fuels are used for mining and refining uranium ore, or if fossil fuels are used when constructing the nuclear power plant, then the emissions from burning those fuels could be associated with the electricity that nuclear power plants generate. However, compared to fossil fuels, the overall carbon footprint remains significantly lower.  
Myth #2: Radioactive Waste is an Unsolvable Problem.  
Nuclear waste, primarily spent fuel rods, remains highly radioactive for millennia. While a permanent disposal solution is still under development, secure storage facilities exist, and advancements in reprocessing technologies offer promise for reducing waste volume. However the impacts of uranium mining and milling on communities and groundwater last for millennia. The federal government keeps a list of the status of clean up for sites with radioactive materials so you can see if you live near one.    
Myth #3: Nuclear Accidents are Inevitable Disasters.  
While accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima raised safety concerns, modern reactors incorporate robust safety features and rigorous regulations. Additionally, the frequency and severity of nuclear accidents are significantly lower compared to incidents at fossil fuel facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission closely monitors nuclear power plants. If an accident does occur, radioactive materials in the plume from the nuclear power plant can settle and contaminate people who are outdoors, buildings, food, water, and livestock. The Centers for Disease Control highlights ways to stay safe during an accident.   
Myth #4: Nuclear Energy is the Only Solution to Climate Change.  
No single technology offers a silver bullet for combating climate change. While nuclear energy can play a role in decarbonizing the grid, it faces challenges like public perception, high upfront costs, and long construction times. Investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency remains crucial.  
Beyond the Myths: Navigating the Nuclear Landscape  
Instead of solely focusing on the ""good"" or ""bad"" of nuclear energy, consider these broader perspectives:  
Embrace a Diverse Energy Mix: Combining nuclear with renewable energy sources like solar and wind can create a more resilient and sustainable grid.  
Prioritize Safety and Security: Continuous advancements in reactor design and stringent regulations are crucial to ensure the safety of nuclear facilities and prevent proliferation risks.  
Investigate Waste Management Solutions: Ongoing research into geological repositories and reprocessing technologies can help address concerns about long-term waste storage.  
Promote Transparency and Public Engagement: Open communication and inclusive decision-making are essential for building public trust and addressing concerns surrounding nuclear energy.  
Support a Holistic Approach: Nuclear energy alone isn't enough. We must invest in energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and behavioral changes to achieve a truly sustainable future."
Discussion: Are you pro or against nuclear energy and why? And if you think the environmental impacts of Nuclear waste are 'worth' it.,I bought all the solar panels I need used for $35 each. I need nothing from the outside world but air. It seems like nuclear plants are security risks that could be avoided if everyone just used only the electric they themselves produced.
Discussion: Are you pro or against nuclear energy and why? And if you think the environmental impacts of Nuclear waste are 'worth' it.,I'm neither. Don't know enough about it to be pro or against.
Discussion: Are you pro or against nuclear energy and why? And if you think the environmental impacts of Nuclear waste are 'worth' it.,"Just to be clear, I have no qualifications for my opinions. My knowledge comes mostly from high school physics (which provided me a basic understanding of how nuclear reactions work, and how electricity is generated by turbines), and Kyle Hill on youtube. if you have not seen his videos, I recommend you watch them as he seems to explain the science of Nuclear reactors with biased (for nuclear), yet factually correct and easy to understand way. 

Based on what I have seen, nuclear energy could be the saviour of man kind. It sounds like it would take very little to design nuclear reactors that would be able to slot right into where a lot of fossil fuel reactors are already insitu. They would be massively more efficient, and exponentially cleaner. It could save the world. The main arguments against nuclear I see from people are safety and waste disposal.

Waste disposal is an easy one to solve/refute. There are already solutions where dangerous waste is simply buried deep in the earth, way below any water tables or anything that could harm the planet. 

Safety is a more abstract argument which is why I think a lot of people struggle with it. From what I understand though, the actual damage of fossil fuels massively outweighs the potential damage of a meltdown, but the publics view has been massively skewed by media like The Simpsons etc. Even video games have their share of blame for the fear mongering around Nuclear. Unless mistaken, There have been three major nuclear incidents in the world:

* Three Mile Island, 
* Fukushima, 
* ...and of course, Chenobyl. 

Of the three, only Chenobyl actually had severe impact. Fukushima had one suspected death due to radiation, and the rest were injuries caused by evacuation and panic. Three Mile Island has had no confirmed deaths, just rampant speculation. Chenobyl was an example of why we should not cut corners, and Id say is less an example of the dangers of nuclear energy, and more an example of the dangers of a corrupt government. 

If you compare the statistics of nuclear to fossel fuel, the numbers do not lie. There has been FAR more waste and FAR more deaths attributed to fossil fuel than nuclear. 

So I'm pro-nuclear. I don't think nuclear fission is the end goal, but simply a stepping stone until nuclear fusion, or renewable energy is ready to take over. Its not the final solution, but it could be the lifeboat humanity needs.

 The only argument that I don't really have an answer for is this. If the money it would take to convert the world to nuclear, be instead poured into renewable energy research, would we be able to skip nuclear? Again, I don't have an answer. 

What do you people think?"
What do you think of nuclear energy,"It emits a lot less carbon than most other sources but it won't save us from climate change.

Compared to renewable sources, nuclear is very slow to roll out and often a lot more expensive.  If we wanted a nuclear solution, we needed to start in the early 2000s not now.  By the 2030s most electricity will probably be from low carbon sources. Wind will be largest but existing hydro and new solar as well as a few other sources will also make significant contributions.

The next challenge is not so much generation but electrifying our heating and transport systems, and making them more efficient.  That of course means heat pumps, solar collectors and lots of insulation as well as lots of public transport, cycling and electric cars in rural areas.  Building that infrastructure will be as important as where the energy comes from."
What do you think of nuclear energy,"I like nuclear but I'm not convinced it can become the ""transitional"" power source before renewables. Even if it had full support right now, it takes a really long time to build nuclear plants. It would probably be at least 20-30 years before it could be our main power source. In the meantime, we'd still rely on fossil fuels. 

Then there's the issue that it's impossible to get widespread support. Highly publicized disasters make people nervous (even if they are super rare). Nobody wants to live near that perceived risk. Nuclear waste is also an issue, and we don't really have a great solution for that. 

Renewables are improving very quickly. Realistically, I think renewables (with storage) will develop faster than we could transition to nuclear. I think we should continue to use nuclear, but I don't think it will be our main source of energy in the foreseeable future."

Battery technology isn't good enough to get by only with wind and solar currently and it likely won't be for a long time, in order to meet demands when these aren't producing we need something that can produce reliably and on demand. Currently that is mostly fossil fuels but nuclear could fill this spot very well. Additionally, large-scale wind and solar have large footprints as far as how much land they use. Nuclear does not need anywhere near as much space.  It's not the sole answer but it's part of the answer"

"Why if climate change will create scenarios that are impossible for scientists to predict, people still obsessed over nuclear energy?",Good question! Nuclear energy might be good right now but to me it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to shove the used radioactive leftovers into the ground for thousands of years to come. And since the usage is so low like 15% of the input uranium is used and then all of it is ruined and need storage it seems pretty wasteful.
"Why if climate change will create scenarios that are impossible for scientists to predict, people still obsessed over nuclear energy?","The main feature of current energy options is that they are centralized. One person/company/government can tap one source, control the flow and profit handsomely and reliably, for decades.

Most renewable sources are decentralized. With few ways to control the energy pouring in from a billion rooftops. The only person becoming a billionaire off solar is the guy making the panels. And that‚Äôs just once. 

Creating dynasties requires years of enhanced income. And the only carbon free option for doing that is controlling what comes out of a reactor."

How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"Energy engineer and policy guy here.

Existing nuclear will play a role for the next couple of decades, tops, as grid upgrades and new generation resources come online. 

However, I firmly believe we won't see the nuclear renaissance moving forward that so many in other subreddits are convinced is just around the corner. Economically and operationally, it just doesn't make sense in the United States to build new nuclear - which is why it's not happening. 

The cancellation of the CFPP is going to be the death knell of small modular reactors, at least in the short - term, though I honestly don't have a lot of faith in any potential for it in the longer term either- again, costs and too many questions about where they would realistically be allowed to be built. 

Let me know if you have any other questions."
How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"Nuclear will be absolutely crucial to achieve net zero CO2 emissions. Renewables are great, but once you get past 60%, adding more has hugely diminishing returns. Solar doesn't help at all at this point, cause we're talking about a northern hemisphere winter night. Trans-continental grids will help wind even out, but up to a point and the scale of investment and complexity is mind boggling.

Energy storage is of course critical, but you can't reach 100% renewable with it in any imaginable time scale. Pumped hydro are the only means of storing energy in relevant scale, but they won't cut it either. We have hundreds or maybe thousands of those lakes/generators/pumps running currently, globally. For bridgjng the summer-winter storage needs, we would need about 3 orders of magnitude more. Yes, possibly millions new artificial lakes with electric plants. Basically, unimaginable amount.

So we can either keep burning fossils and try to catch their CO2 (not very practical and possibly impossible for net zero) or go more into nuclear, which will be very expensive and politically challenging. Or we can hope for startrek-level scientific discoveries while we pump carbon into the atmosphere.

Let that sink in: we either go nuclear, or we keep heating up the planet in the forseeable future."
How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"Depends on the country. China is building nuclear more successfully than anyone else at the moment. Currently it‚Äôs only ~2% of their energy mix, but they are trying to build up to 10 new reactors each year to add about 15x more power from nuclear by 2035 (21 GW -> 300 GW). Considering they don‚Äôt really have to ask permission and the federal government has given that directive, I‚Äôd imagine they will likely be successful in building much more nuclear generation, maybe not 15x more but a lot. 

In the rest of the world, it‚Äôs too expensive politically and financially, and SMRs don‚Äôt seem to be very small, modular, or real at this point. They don‚Äôt have any commercial scale and if nuclear is gonna be a climate solution, we needed to be breaking ground at the turn of the century. With how long it takes to build, permit, site, and with high interest rates for the foreseeable future, new nuclear may be basically dead outside of China. It‚Äôs way cheaper and easier to build a ton of renewables and batteries, and there‚Äôs a ton of incentives to build all that. The same incentives don‚Äôt exist for nuclear. 

We should keep our existing nuclear fleet online as long as we can, but we should plan as if none or very little more of it will be built. Because it is really unlikely it will. Would it be helpful? Maybe in the long term, but we need to halve emissions by 2030, in about 6 years. Nuclear doesn‚Äôt fit the timeframe."
How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"You forgot timeframes. It takes 15-20 years to build a single nuclear power plant. Based on that alone it is probably now not a viable solution to achieving our climate goals for 2050.

Uranium and other radioactive elements are also a finite resource so it's only a stop gap solution."
How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"I hope zero. I do not trust that humans for the next 1000+ years will consistently manage to refrain from doing something catastrophically stupid with the nuclear waste. It only takes one rogue government or well funded private entity to dig the stuff with ill intentions up and we end up with a nightmare scenario. 

Fix the waste disposal problems so all nuclear waste is totally safe within 50 years and we can re-consider. I know people are working on it and with some success, so that comment is not meant as sarcasm."
How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"Very little. Solar and wind are sucking all the air out of the room and I expect nuclear to have only a winding down. I didn't expect this 5 years ago but it's a done deal now.

What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"Nuclear waste is a difficult concept. On the one hand, there's indeed not that much of it, on the other hand, nuclear waste remains dangerous to humans over extremely long timespans. In my opinion, the problem is not about the amount of waste, but about the time it remains dangerous.

According to [this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-waste-lethal-trash-or-renewable-energy-source/) article, the waste will remain deadly to humans for 250000 years. [Others](https://mosaicscience.com/story/how-do-you-leave-warning-lasts-long-nuclear-waste/) say that it's even up to a million years. Some people also [say less](https://qr.ae/pvwVDK) with 100000 years. According to [this chart](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-851771df26a3356c03353ad0506a0a7a-pjlq), reprocessed waste still has \~1000x radiation emissions of uranium ore after 250000 years, or 10000x for untreated waste.

What we are currently doing with nuclear power is producing waste -however little it is- that we are burdening our future species with, not for decades, or centuries or even millennia, but for hundreds of thousands of years. If we'd go back that far in time humans were not even using tools yet, we're basically standing at the cradle of humanity.

While the benefits for us now are enormous, and the current dangers likely manageable, we are burdening our species so far into the future that we can literally not even imagine how our species would look like -if we're even still there-. This is a timespan so large, we can't be sure in any way how the storage, our language, or even simple symbols indicating danger could survive or be interpreted. It is frankly arrogant to assume that the burden of this waste is not a problem for our future."
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"I can't believe there's so much resistance to it in my country (Australia), when it makes the most sense to have it here more than anywhere else in the world.

There are no fault lines through the continent, so earthquakes are rare and, when they have occurred, are relatively weak. Deep geological disposal could be carried out securely in the swathes of unpopulated land we have.

Heck, we sell a lot of coal overseas, but as many countries plan on phasing it out, we need a new opportunity for our future in energy resources."
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"Personally, if regulated and built correctly, Nuclear power is key to our future. Current designs aren't great in terms of cost and effectiveness which is where things like SSNR (Small-Scale Nuclear Reactors) are something I'm interested in. Designed to fail-safe, passive cooling systems and a 30 year lifespan plus they're easier to refurbish/ refuel/ replace mean these could be the future of Nuclear energy.  
It'd also solve an issue we are currently facing with Ukraine. If under threat, the reactors can be disconnected and moved out of hot-zones. They could then be reconnected at back-up sites and can begin providing power again.   


And you're right on the waste front. Some of the newer reactor designs use current reactor waste products and extract as much energy out of the material as possible. Reprocessing of nuclear fuels could mean we get so much more out of them AND we're left with less volatile waste that also has a far, far shorter half-life (as little as 100 years compared to the 10,000 or so years of current designs).   


Oh and it's almost impossible to have these reactors make fissile material (that goes into nuclear warheads) so they wouldn't make THAT issue any more worse than it already is.   


While I'd still want them fairly far away from major settlements, I'd be happy if my country started using SSNRs to meet baseload requirements with our extensive network of renewables making up the rest. But trying to convince the wider public of their safety is an immense uphill struggle. Five Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima are all prominent in people's minds when it comes to nuclear energy despite France having ran off of reactors for most of their energy since the 1970s. I hope that perception changes soon and we start seeing more nuclear technological advancements and deployment in future :)"
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"Nuclear power in its current form is extremely expensive and takes decades to implement. Current designs are also not intended for demand response (like a ‚Äúpeaker plant‚Äù), so they won‚Äôt play nicely with our future grid that is powered by renewables and will have strong daily swings in supply & demand. Fission reactors also require a complicated fuel supply chain that can increase the risk of nuclear weapon proliferation and require careful, indefinite, politically toxic storage of spent fuel.

Given the climate crisis and need for low carbon energy, It‚Äôs probably a good idea to try to keep existing nuclear power plants online until we can replace them with hydroelectric, solar, wind, or geothermal energy. But given how rapidly we need to move to a low carbon electrical grid, I don‚Äôt see much point in starting new nuclear plant projects now. They would take decades to finish.

The one exception might be a wave of small modular reactors that are in development right now. If they can operate economically and safely AND be built very quickly, they might be worthwhile."
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,#Thorium
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"Nuclear waste has to be isolated from the biosphere for 240,000 years. The human race only learned to write its name 6,000 years ago. Fission plants have no place in the biosphere."
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"Wind and solar are too cheap for Nuclear to be able to compete. There are lots of options to store energy for cloudy days and more being researched. Personally, I would like to see local residential energy storage so that everyone is not affected by outages in the grid. 
We should not forget that nuclear requires expensive grid maintenance while solar+local storage does not."
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,Big waste of money and takes far too long to construct to have a meaningful impact on our current conundrum. The currently operational ones are great and we should keep them but the situation is too desperate to build new ones.
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,"I think it's the most logical step for our civilization:
Coal -> Oil -> Gas -> Nuclear"
What do you guys think of nuclear power?,I think modular molten salt reactors that can use the current nuclear waste for fuel do have a place in the world until we get our act together
Scientists Turn Nuclear Waste Into Diamond Batteries That Could Last For Thousands Of Years,So they turn carbon-14 radioisotopes from the graphite moderator rods into diamonds and embed those in carbon-12 diamonds to contain radiation. And then what? Peltier?

Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,"Shutting down existing ones often increases reliance on fossil fuel plants, which is a terrible trade-off"
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,"I share the same views as Kurzgesagt on the issue (if you‚Äôve seen their video on it). We‚Äôll need it in the short term as a part of the fix, but it can‚Äôt be a long term solution. Renewable is the way to go."
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,The anti-nuclear crowd is not being serious about climate change.
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,I'm pretty sure this being 2022 not 1970 that nuclear power is incredibly safe and full proof. But I can't help but think that people are generally dumb and facts aren't a basis for decision making any more. So well never implement new power plants.
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,"If we use self-regulating molten salt reactors with a half-live measured in hundreds of years: Yay!

If we use reactors which have the ability to explode when disturbed, which are producing Plutonium for building A-Bombs and having a half-life measured in millions of years: Nay!"
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,Yay if you know what's clean for yah.
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,"Both.

Its not like we stopped using wood when we started digging up coal, or coal when we started pumping oil and gas. We use more of each of those fuel sources than ever before; its not instead of its 'as well as'.

Nuclear power should be part of our energy mix for many reasons; vast amounts of energy from a non-fossil fuel source. The pollution it generates while dangerous is small in volume and i think we can manage it, and the trade off against developing the technology seems fair. If we crack fusion as applied engineering then more than fair.

However...

In my opinion it is still an environmentally insensitive technology, and as such should not form the bulk of our energy generation. Rather act as a buffer for truly renewable and green energy sources, and an industry for developing the tech.
Its main draw backs imo being; it does not redistribute energy production and represents a technocratic high tech single point of failure; requires vast up front material and capital investment; like fossil fuels and unlike other 'renewables' it burns a finite resource as an additional energy source to the sun forcing the ghg global warming effect.

I think we should have nuclear power, not much, to buffer other sources only and maintain development of the tech."
Nuclear Power - Yay or Nay?,"It‚Äôs hard not to think about the gator that‚Äôs got hold of your trouser snake when your intention was draining the swamp.

Does this article contain any facts that might mean that nuclear is more attractive than one might have thought?,"SMRs have *always* been incredibly dubious. The idea that they'll make nuclear more affordable through modularity means that they first have to overcome the loss of vertical scale. Paul Martin writes some great pieces on this at his LinkedIn. 

Google: Scaling Examples Pt. 1: Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMNRs) by Paul Martin since apparently you can't post LinkedIn links here. 

If we're going to be building more nuclear power, they should be full scale. We also need to be planning more holistically. Intermittent renewables and storage have high potential and are reducing costs all the time but require major changes to our grid. But what the best option is, is really regionally dependent. Ultimately, renewables and storage are incredibly easy to deploy and a more modernized grid is ultimately a net benefit to human progress. 

[This study](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://iaee2021online.org/download/contribution/fullpaper/1145/1145%255C_fullpaper%255C_20210326%255C_222336.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiyoYuiu4uEAxUFLTQIHSHGAtEQFnoECDAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3lDxDjXYZmRpYgfYGZLIz1) that estimates the Levelized Full System Cost of Electricity of various sources is very compelling in my mind. It shows the huge spatial variability in electrical costs as well as how much can change when you mix sources. It also challenges the concept of conventional nuclear being the most expensive form of power.

Tl;dr We need an energy mix, nuclear is not a silver bullet, and SMRs are a dumb distraction."
Does this article contain any facts that might mean that nuclear is more attractive than one might have thought?,They try to influence ppl‚Äôs minds that war is a good idea.
Does this article contain any facts that might mean that nuclear is more attractive than one might have thought?,I guess that one point about energy is that some things are presumably going to be good technologies in the future (fusion? SMRs? etc.)...but that it's tragic how these technologies will arrive too late to be relevant.
Does this article contain any facts that might mean that nuclear is more attractive than one might have thought?,"Nuclear remains very expensive. With the proce of solar dropping yearly, nuclear will struggle to compete. Especially as technology to recycle solar farms goes gangbusters."
Does this article contain any facts that might mean that nuclear is more attractive than one might have thought?,"Naval reactor plants aren't SMRs. 

There was only one company in the US that had a design far enough along to even get the beginnings of NRC licensure, and they're about to go belly up. 

Everything else for SMRs in the US is just investment and tech douche bros begging for federal and venture capital funding as a form of corporate welfare using buzzwords and manufactured hype vi badly written articles like this one written by authors with often dubious ties to big oil, big tech, or some combination of the two. 

It's all smoke and mirrors, and everybody knows it, except the poor rubes here on Reddit who think they're experts because they've spent a couple hours on YouTube."

Does this article contain any facts that might mean that nuclear is more attractive than one might have thought?,"Not sure, safety systems must be multiplied for many little plants instead of having one for a bigger output. In fact the risk is to spend more for safety systems (wich is quite a big item for nuclear costs) or to simply abolish safety standards and make more common leakings and problems wich can affect a smaller area."
