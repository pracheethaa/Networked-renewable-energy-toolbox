      "This green energy push is alot of hogwash. We here in the United States arent  ready to go 100%  green . When we are great but until then we should have kept our energy independence  and sold the crap out of it to help pay for this technology.  Instead our energy bills are though the roof with no sign of going down.\n",

      "Just remember that both solar and wind installations are required to be backed up by Natural Gas Power Plants running at nearly full capacity, so that when it becomes dark or the wind is outside the safe range and the solar power and wind power shut down, there are no blackouts.\n",
      "Wind energy can also cause desertification due the changes of wind patterns drying the land and it is still not economical without subsidies.\n",
      "Meanwhile airlines who emit 1.4 billion tons of Co2 annually will continue to add routes and flights increasing the emissions by 20% in 2035.\n",
      "If we want to take the top off the climate catastrophe barreling towards us we need to renew tax credits for renewables, but expand those tax credits. Tragically my fellow Republicans have completely abandoned conserving the environment like Republican President Teddy Roosevelt. If we want to pass on an inheritance to our children let’s strongly support those that will vote for renewing tax credits for wind, solar and geothermal energy.\n",

      "Theories and practicals are not the same\n",
      "Except one windmill at max capacity is 3 MW. A nuclear plant will generate a gigawatt so it will take 333 windmills running at max capacity 24/7 to equal 1 nuclear plant at normal capacity.

      "A couple years ago Wind power provided 2.5% of the grid power, using just over 50 thousand Wind Turbines.  So, by doing the math that means we will need 20 times more or 1 Million Wind Turbines to get to 50%.  Good luck with that.\n",

Also, transmission is completely ignored, mentioned 9 times in a 109 page report, 6 times in the same sentence repeated across the various summaries.\n",
      "No it won’t. Do you know how much oil is in one of those things somethings Gotta keep it cool. When they leak they get oil everywhere and it’s also it makes them catch on fire.

      "DO RENEWABLE PPAS PROVIDE THE SAME SUPPORT TOWARD MEETING NIPSCO’S PEAK SYSTEM DEMAND AS NIPSCO’S TRANSMISSION AND CONVENTIONAL GENERATION FACILITIES?To an extent, yes. However, the issue is that renewable facilities cannot be counted on to the same extent as transmission facilities and conventional generation facilities to support NIPSCO’s peak system demand. Transmission facilities, since they are passive in nature and typically have a very low forced outage rate, have a very high availability of nearly 100% at the time of peak system demand. Conventionalgeneration facilities, due to their fuel arrangements and having equivalent forcedoutage rates typically in the range of 5 to 25%,have an availability 75 to 95% of theirsummer rated MW capability at the time of peak system demand. In contrast, the most recent studies by NIPSCO’s Regional Transmission Organization (“RTO”) show that, on a MISO-wide basis, wind generation facilities on average can be expected to have an availability of approximately 15.2% of their nameplate MW rating at the time of peak system demand and solar generation facilities can be expected to have an availability of approximately 50% of their nameplate capability at the time of peak system demand. Therefore, with respect to supporting peak system demand, a nameplate MW of wind generation capacity on average provides approximately 16 to 20% of the same support that would be provided by a summer rated capability MW of conventional generation. Similarly, a nameplate MW of solar generation capacity on average provides approximately 53 to 67% of the same support toward meeting peak demand that would be provided by a summer rated capability MW of conventional generation. Given this, a minimum of 16% of the total cost of wind PPAs and a minimum 53% of the total cost of solar PPAs should be allocated to customer classes on the same basis as the fixedcosts of conventional generating facilities.Testimony from Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission hearing for cause #45194 NIPSCO,Rosewater wind in 2019.\n",
      "The government fixed affordable health care for us. Let them fix efficient and renewable energy too.\n",
      "Except….people don’t want them near to where they live.   They want them somewhere else.\n",
      "The Texas wind turbines failure was because owners decided not to invest in the weatherizing needed to deal with temperatures below 10 deg. F which Texas experienced in February 2021.   As with most facilities, you don't invest to protect against rare events.   Having said that, the main problem with wind power is on average the capacity factor of U.S. wind turbines is only 35% (see EIA data) and wind power produced in the U.S. is lowest in August when electricity demand is the highest.   So back up generation capacity is needed which these days usually comes from coal and natural gas.   Iowa is a good example since they have a significant amount of wind turbines.  Check out this EIA data on Iowa for 2018 - 2019.   Do you see a relationship between wind and coal? https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/...\n",
      "So when will this happen?  This idea has been kicked around for years and nothing has happened.  Where is Bezos?  Where is Elon Musk?  They both could do better than going into space to prove they have money to spend.  Buying Twitter does nothing compared to improving green energy.  NASA going to Mars has its benefits but green energy will save the planet.\n",

      "So why are they predicting, and asking us to be prepared for, massive power shortages this summer?\n",
      "At what price? The wind mills kill birds, they require a lot of expensive maintenance, the blades are not recyclable, and the end cost of the electricity costs more than other forms of generation..\n",

      "Nothing is clean if you add manufacturing and disposal to usage, all your doing is causing new problems in different places, nothing beneficial\n",
      "Good luck with building hundreds of thousands of turbines because they only produce 5-20MW peak. And not guaranteed power and not applicable everywhere in the country. And leaking oil like crazy. And killing hundreds of thousands of birds per year. And wind turbine syndrome. And taking up more farmland. I can go on.\n",

      "And wind mills requires no oil to lubricants\n",
      "Its a lie...look what happened in Texas 2 years ago when temps went down lower than usual\n",

I'll guess all these new wonderful things are 20-30 years off into the future, even if you start building today. Again, what's the hold up? And what do we do in the meantime? Study it some more, maybe?\n",
      "NIPSCO Now Agrees It Overstated The Capacity Value for Indiana Wind Resources in Its IRPHOW DOES NIPSCO VALUE CAPACITY FROM POTENTIAL WIND RESOURCES IN ITS IRP?It uses an estimate that the UCAP (ELCC) of wind resources from PPAs of approximately 13.5%-15% of the installed capacity of those resources.IS THIS CONSISTENT WITH MISO’S CALCULATION OF WIND UCAP?It is consistent with the average across the MISO system in 2017 of 15.2%, but the assigned UCAP for wind varies across the zones in the MISO system based on how likely the wind resource is to operate during MISO’s peak demand hours. Further, MISO projects that, as wind penetration increases, the ELCC of wind resources will fall from the current 15.2% towards 12.5%.WHAT UCAP DOES WIND IN INDIANA RECEIVE?As shown in Figure 1 below, wind in Indiana only received 7.4%. That is less than one-half of the ~15% used in NIPSCO’s IRP. The spread of ELCC and UCAP across MISO is shown in Figure 1 below. The higher ELCCs are in the Plains states, while the lowest is in Indiana. \n",
