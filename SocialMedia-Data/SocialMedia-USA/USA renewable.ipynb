      "After moving in with my mom to take care of her & my uncle with dementia, my house across town slowly fell apart after 12 years.I had a few leaks & needed a new roof. Saw an ad stating the gov will put a roof on if you agree to add solar panels. Pay $192 for 7-8 years instead of paying an electric bill. I looked up the facts on several gov websites to verify. Since my kids are grown & I kicked my ex to the curb, I use ¼ the power, to sell back to the electric Co. Win Win.The group threw in a new HVAC since mine went down.

      "This is why, along with solar and wind power, nuclear reactors are a necessary part of of adequately providing for the power grid. I recommend thorium and molten salt reactors.\n",
      "It's always going to be a losing battle as long as the population is increasing. Stop people from breeding recklessly, and every other problem becomes manageable. But there's been no effort or interest in forcing people to limit breeding, so things will continue to get worse.\n",
      "We will never make less renewable power than we do today.\n",
      "Wind solar has a very short lifecycle ...Nuclear is the only answer...modern clean-with no long term waste issues.\n",
      "Renewables are good as part of the overall solution. Scalability, cost, geographical and most importantly reliability issues are barriers to their being a cost effective 100% solution for high, 7x24 demand sectors such as heavy industry, cloud data centers and AI.\n",
      "The main problem we have now is that storage batteries for evening out the delivery flow of uneven sources like solar and wind is prohibitively expensive. So utility companies are replacing coal plants with natural gas instead of renewables.\n",
      "Nuclear\n",
      "Change is inevitable in both demand and energy production. \n",
      "We could always set about using and wasting less. We don’t need half the stuff we think we do, we don’t need to make so many unnecessary journeys, or use so many power hungry items in our homes. The less stuff we consume, the less energy needed to obtain the raw materials, manufacture it, package it, transport it and finally to dispose of it when we get fed up with it.\n",
      "Solar panels are cheap, widely available and seem to far surpassing their original projected lifespan. Looking at 75 years now! For the issue of reducing carbon emissions we need everything. All the renewables and probably nuclear too. The new much smaller reactors are interesting. But solar is so cheap.\n",
      "Wind energy sounds great until you learned big corp (ie. Boeing) got the contracts instead of indie American startups! And their huge flawed turbines towers are expensive, killing birds, explode during certain storms...\n",
      "Nuclear is the only real solution\n",
      "So quit using so much electricity!\n",
      "Cool, love the green energy. But we'd like more nuke please.\n",
      "Meanwhile, China commissioned 340 new coal plants last year, despite also adding significant renewables based capacity. India is also increasing emissions significantly.So whatever we do locally is unlikely to make a substantive difference in a global scale. But at least we can still feel good about it.\n",
      "They're also fracking champions which is great for us because that's where we get most if our LNG from. Which in turn ensures we can keep our lights on.Of course we could have our own fracking revolution providing our own energy security and bringing loads if lovely income selling the surplus. But of course all the bloody snowflakes and eco loonies have put paid to that.\n",
      "Nuclear is the only technologically viable solution,  it takes 2~3 MILLION pounds of coal/oil/gas to equal the energy in 1 pound of uranium, its a no-brainer, IIRC we have already mined enough to power the entire world for something like the next 400 years.  People have to get over their irrational fear of nuclear,  for example ~20,000 people died from the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, not a single person died of radiation, yes it was and still is a contamination disaster because of engineering stupidity, but in spite of that stupidity not a single person has died from radiation.\n",
      "The key is to transition away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible. No reasonable person is suggesting we dump all fossil fuels and nuclear overnight.  \n",
      "Just going off the Headlines, I am going to throw my 2cents in.. \n",
      "Nuclear.\n",
      "New nuclear technology:\n",
      "Takes time to ramp up new energy sources, always has, always will\n",
      "In the UK energy-efficiency has improved each year, but instead of building sustainable communities and local power networks, it introduces daft ideas like battery-powered transport and Air-Source-Heat-Pumps!We have to live within the constraints of what the planet can provide...\n",
      "Unless it continues to shatter records as it will. Maybe when people actual see there is no denying the climate emergency as smoke blankets the continent and extreme weather disasters continue to escalate along with the billions in comets then people will be smarter about usage of available power. The addiction to comfort and convenience and the belief that that is a right and not a privilege is the problem. If it is cold where more clothes. Use less power. If it is hot ….use other methods to cool yourself and use less power. But that is not responsible to expect self sacrifice without 100% acceptance of the emergency. Unfortunately  that is why mandates are needed and that will just incite more division as we move forward in the most divisive time we have ever seen.\n",
      "so the infrastructure is still not ready for mandated electric vehicles\n",
      "That's why we're building more \n",
      "Useless. Nuclear and oil.\n",
      "Cut back on oil refining...\n",
      "My county just killed a big solar project that had already been approved and was started. My recommendation is to vote out all the Regthuglicans in Porter County Indiana. \n",
      "So did you think it was going to happen overnight?\n",
      "“The Rhodium Group, an energy modeling firm, estimates the U.S. needs to install between 32 GW and 95 GW of new wind and solar capacity every year through 2035 in order to cut emissions 32 percent to 51 percent compared to 2005 levels.”\n",
      "Perhaps demands should not always be met.\n",
      "Emissions still rising  it's getting hotter faster\n",
      "Those solar wind mills are working great out in the ocean. Lol oh wait!! They killing a lot of sea life. Thanks to their loud noises and vibrations\n",
      "follow plz muja 300 followers k zarort hai hlp me \n",
      "No kidding\n",
      "The noise from solar windmills will give us all cancer and flipper babies.\n",
      "It's not \"demand\". It's just usage. We waste far too much. We could easily reduce energy use by a third w/o serious inconvenience.And a lot of energy use is totally stupid. War, for example. Holiday flights, driving a muscle car 20 km twice a day to stuff our fat faces with fast food. Shall I go on?Houses are 40% bigger than a generation ago, even tho families are smaller. And we are neither healthier nor happier. Go minimalist:: Waste not, want not.\n",
      "Nuclear is the only way to go.\n",
      "Not even close to being enough.\n",
      "It's not enough because it needs more infrastructure\n",
