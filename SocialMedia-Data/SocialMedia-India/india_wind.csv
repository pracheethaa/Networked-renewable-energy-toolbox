"'A total switch to solar and wind energy is impossible since these are produced only intermittently when the sun shines and wind blows, maybe 25% of the year on an average. For the rest of the time, India needs coal-based electricity.'","The initiative that the United Nations has taken is absolutely unwarranted.One should take logical words or beautiful sound or realistic projects.Those of you who are taking videos or different types of offers to kids or different ways.All of you in the world will have to go back to the primitive age when your project is settled.All technology technologies have to be shut down.Power generation has to be stopped.You have to close the factories only if you have to implement them.An unrealistic project or proposal.Ask those who have been agitating to sleep away on the street, away from everything else.And my suggestions are the simplest realistic human welfare.In the present age, all is needed and this age is the economic age.How to create economic development and employment, grow the industry, plant more fruit trees.Some forests in the summer are already in the forests.And to reduce the amount of fruit trees is needed.The fruit will be taken care of all the time.Summer will also reduce the incidence of fire.People will get the benefit or benefit of billions of hectares of land.It was through accepting my project.By planting millions of hectares of fruit on the vacant land in the japan with the emphasis on neighborhoods, you will create employment for many people there.That's it.The following are some of the points:It is high time to change the world just your one good disitions.Climate Action!Climate change is a big issue.It is not a matter of crying to any young child.Anyone who cries will be solved.In this economic age everyone wants to take his business forward.Climate change affects everyone.Not just the poor.Everyone can benefit if they take the right initiative.Good initiative must be taken by all.So that the market place in the world is growing.Because in the present age, everyone wants a share of the profits.Industries such as Industries for Sounds that will accelerate business growth.The middle class will find a path to action.The lower ones will also work in that place.People will benefit from it.Example:1. The oxygen levels will rise.2. The amount of carbon will be reduced.3. The temperature will be minus 1.5% Celsius.4. The sea pressure will be low. Slowly will remain normal.5. The poor people will get food. So that people get nutrition.6. Business will grow in a social way.7. The elites will benefit from the environment and business.8. There will be employment for the middle and lower classes.9. The poor will have vitamin-rich foods.10. That food will continue to be more in the market.11. Ice melts.12. Its usefulness cannot be eliminated.The world will benefit from this for ages.For example, the fruit of the vine will be traded through the fruit. Increasing production will reduce costs and increase income. Prices will decrease. The dried grapes are also sold as food.How many trees, fruits, employment, nutrients will be eliminated, business, etc. only once.Planting only fruit trees has many benefits.Imagine that there are many benefits to such an environment as well as to human beings and nature.Implement.Let the world move forward.From~ Bangladesh............Edit or delete thisLike · Reply · 1m"
