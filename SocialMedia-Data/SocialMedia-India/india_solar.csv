"1,000 years ago, worshippers built a Sun Temple in Modhera. Today, the sun provides all its energy  Learn how other countries can accelerate their solar energy transitions: http://ow.ly/pqGq50LmS4RUnited Nations",Looks like the solar panels have covered up all the fields where food could be grown.
"1,000 years ago, worshippers built a Sun Temple in Modhera. Today, the sun provides all its energy  Learn how other countries can accelerate their solar energy transitions: http://ow.ly/pqGq50LmS4RUnited Nations",please explain how the solar panels generate electricity 24 hours a day ? that’s a new one.

Or how many crops could be grown?  Where are they diposing of the old cells?  If they are running even when dark, what type batteries, where are they mined and where disposed of."
"1,000 years ago, worshippers built a Sun Temple in Modhera. Today, the sun provides all its energy  Learn how other countries can accelerate their solar energy transitions: http://ow.ly/pqGq50LmS4RUnited Nations","That's over 30 acres for a small  village.  A community like Santa Paula, with about 30,000 residents would need about 125 acres of solar panels, and a significant number of rooftop installations.  A city the size of Ventura, with about 120,000 residents would need considerably more that 500 acres of solar panels!  If we aren't going to eliminate all household electricity so we can  divert that power to EVs, we need to start concentrating on nuclear power plants."

"1,000 years ago, worshippers built a Sun Temple in Modhera. Today, the sun provides all its energy  Learn how other countries can accelerate their solar energy transitions: http://ow.ly/pqGq50LmS4RUnited Nations","Yes... solar power. The most important part of the video is that with all those solar panels they managed to satisfy the need of 7000, yes ONLY SEVEN THOUSAND people.

Wind power is likewise subject to so many variables that it is totally useless except to charge batteries for backup power.  The government forces local utilities to buy ""excess electricity"" from solar panels to make the panels more affordable, but that drives up the price of electricity because the solar power is generated during the lowest power window.  We need natural gas generators for the time being, and build nuclear generators for the future. That won't happen as long as the president is suffering from dementia!"
