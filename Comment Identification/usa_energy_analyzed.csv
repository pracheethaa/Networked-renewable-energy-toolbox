That means you need to look at the Ukraine bar to see the drop in production after the Chernobyl accident, and it wasn't all that much. The post-Fukushima drop in Japan is much more dramatic, as they shut down all of their plants after it. I cannot take seriously anyone who excludes nuclear energy as a tool in our strategies to mitigate climate change: nuclear's carbon emissions are negligible compared to fossil fuels and it will serve as a useful bridge/fallback in situations where wind and solar are not available. The occasional accidents are certainly concerning, and Chernobyl was a huge near-miss in terms of the potential for widespread ecological damage (watch the excellent HBO miniseries to learn about this), but the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks when considering the havoc climate change will cause if serious mitigation policies are not implemented soon.

However, the issue is that renewable facilities cannot be counted on to the same extent as transmission facilities and conventional generation facilities to support NIPSCOâ€™s peak system demand. Transmission facilities, since they are passive in nature and typically have a very low forced outage rate, have a very high availability of nearly 100% at the time of peak system demand. Conventionalgeneration facilities, due to their fuel arrangements and having equivalent forcedoutage rates typically in the range of 5 to 25%,have an availability 75 to 95% of theirsummer rated MW capability at the time of peak system demand. In contrast, the most recent studies by NIPSCOâ€™s Regional Transmission Organization (â€œRTOâ€) show that, on a MISO-wide basis, wind generation facilities on average can be expected to have an availability of approximately 15.2% of their nameplate MW rating at the time of peak system demand and solar generation facilities can be expected to have an availability of approximately 50% of their nameplate capability at the time of peak system demand. Therefore, with respect to supporting peak system demand, a nameplate MW of wind generation capacity on average provides approximately 16 to 20% of the same support that would be provided by a summer rated capability MW of conventional generation. Similarly, a nameplate MW of solar generation capacity on average provides approximately 53 to 67% of the same support toward meeting peak demand that would be provided by a summer rated capability MW of conventional generation. Given this, a minimum of 16% of the total cost of wind PPAs and a minimum 53% of the total cost of solar PPAs should be allocated to customer classes on the same basis as the fixedcosts of conventional generating facilities.Testimony from Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission hearing for cause #45194 NIPSCO,Rosewater wind in 2019.","DO RENEWABLE PPAS PROVIDE THE SAME SUPPORT TOWARD MEETING NIPSCOâ€™S PEAK SYSTEM DEMAND AS NIPSCOâ€™S TRANSMISSION AND CONVENTIONAL GENERATION FACILITIES?To an extent, yes.
