If it goes ahead, the line will open the Galilee Basin and with it a big new minerals province in Queensland.The environmental and political stakes are high, as shown by a series of ABC reports this week that prosecute the moral case against Adani.Information in the latest ABC “exclusive” revelations is neither new nor confirmed.India’s Customs Department has been investigating price-­rigging allegations against 40 companies for more than two years. News that Adani was asked to ­explain itself was widely reported in India more than three months ago. Adani’s use of tax havens has been a topic of intense interest and speculation for more than two years.The Greens have called previously for a Senate investigation and the issue has been raised in earlier Environment Department deliberations.As Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan has said, Australian authorities have long been satisfied the corporate structures are legal. As for the price-rigging claims, a presumption of innocence prevails.The allegation is that Adani manipulated the declared price of imported coal to the detriment of Indian power consumers. No findings have been made against Adani, which denies the claims.Canavan says the issue of whether Adani will get financial assistance for the rail infrastructure from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility remains a matter for the independent board.Green groups claim the board is stacked by mining interests, and Greens spokesman Adam Bandt has accused Canavan of becoming “minister for Adani”. Bandt’s main objective for doing so was to ­defend the ABC.","The ABC is beating up old news to further the global anti-coal war against Indian miner Adani.Adani has yet to fund the ­Carmichael project but it is getting closer, with conditional approval for $1 billion in government assistance for its needed rail line. If it goes ahead, the line will open the Galilee Basin and with it a big new minerals province in Queensland.The environmental and political stakes are high, as shown by a series of ABC reports this week that prosecute the moral case against Adani.Information in the latest ABC “exclusive” revelations is neither new nor confirmed.India’s Customs Department has been investigating price-­rigging allegations against 40 companies for more than two years. News that Adani was asked to ­explain itself was widely reported in India more than three months ago. Adani’s use of tax havens has been a topic of intense interest and speculation for more than two years.The Greens have called previously for a Senate investigation and the issue has been raised in earlier Environment Department deliberations.As Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan has said, Australian authorities have long been satisfied the corporate structures are legal. As for the price-rigging claims, a presumption of innocence prevails.The allegation is that Adani manipulated the declared price of imported coal to the detriment of Indian power consumers. No findings have been made against Adani, which denies the claims.Canavan says the issue of whether Adani will get financial assistance for the rail infrastructure from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility remains a matter for the independent board.Green groups claim the board is stacked by mining interests, and Greens spokesman Adam Bandt has accused Canavan of becoming “minister for Adani”.
