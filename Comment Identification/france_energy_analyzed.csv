Nuclear,My thoughts on Nuclear.,"I understand your concerns about the safety of nuclear power and they are legitimate concerns, but you are completely ignoring the advantages. Nuclear power is the only form of ""cleaner"" energy that can realistically compete with coal power plants and other similar fossil fuel power sources. The design failures you mentioned are extremely rare and because of the amount of danger that a malfunction poses, more failsafes and precautions are put in place on nuclear reactors than anything else in the world. The biggest problem with nuclear power is what to do with the waste that it generates, we need a better solution than bury it. Nuclear power has its problems but the benefits outweigh the negatives.","I understand your concerns about the safety of nuclear power and they are legitimate concerns, but you are completely ignoring the advantages.

Nuclear,On being pro nuclear energy(?) and anti nuclear weapons,"When it comes to fusion ‚Äî in the 1970s there was research on inertial confinement for power production, but most everything since that time has been directed to understanding and modelling the phenomena of thermonuclear explosions, in the context of a world in which the international political order is based on nuclear deterrence, but actually testing the weapons is largely taboo. To some extent, that's not about what the physicists want to do, but about what they can get funding for. But it's also true that getting power out of an ICF system is at least as difficult as getting it out of a magnetic-confinement system. When people start talking seriously about porous ceramic walls weeping liquid lithium, and about 99% recovery of unburned tritium, it should be clear that the engineering challenges are such that we shouldn't expect a practical, economic powerplant any time soon.

Now, when it comes to fission, the key thing to realize is that, yes, there is some overlap between the technology required for power and the technology required for bombs. But if you look at any of the countries which have actually built bombs, you will see that none of them have used nuclear power plants or fuel-cycle facilities built for civil purposes to get to that point. To the contrary : Britain, after building its first bombs using plutonium from the Windscale piles, built Calder Hall and Chapelcross to make weapons plutonium with electricity as a by-product, and then operated those plants for decades as pure power-producers. Similarly, the British enrichment plant was originally built to provide weapons material, and then switched over to civil fuel.

In most cases, countries which have built bombs did so before they built power plants ; China is an extreme example. And in Pakistan, although the CANDU-type Karachi power plant was operating for many years before an attempt was made to build a bomb, that bomb used highly enriched uranium from clandestine centrifuges.

Honestly, if you ask me about the link between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, I'll tell you that the only time nuclear weapons have been used in war was in a war that started over control of oil supplies. The longer we allow control of fossil fuels to dominate world politics, the more chances there are that someone will decide to use nuclear weapons. You certainly can't eliminate nuclear weapons by banning civil fission power.","When it comes to fusion ‚Äî in the 1970s there was research on inertial confinement for power production, but most everything since that time has been directed to understanding and modelling the phenomena of thermonuclear explosions, in the context of a world in which the international political order is based on nuclear deterrence, but actually testing the weapons is largely taboo.

Nuclear,On being pro nuclear energy(?) and anti nuclear weapons,"Yo, forget about fusion for a moment because it is off the table at least for the next 100 years. Lets talk about fission insted, which we have and use. Enriched uranium follows mainly 4 enrichment levels. You need enriched uranium to do both fuel and bombs, being that they follow the principle of chain reaction (tho inside a reactor it is controlled, while in a bomb it is purposefully not), this is very very simplified.

Natural Uranium: ‚âà99.3% 238U which is stable, ‚âà0.7% 235U which is radioactive

Low Enriched Uranium: 3-5% 235U

Highly Enriched Uranium: up to 20% 235U

Military Grade Uranium: >85% 235U

This means basically that a reactor could never explode as a bomb, in fact it never happened and the worst case scenario is the melting of the core and the emission outside of radionuclides and radiation (extremely rare).","Yo, forget about fusion for a moment because it is off the table at least for the next 100 years.

Firstly, what are you talking about with Nuclear Power Plants producing fallout?  I'm sure you meant another word, as they most certainly do not produce fallout. 

What I gather you're talking about it reusing spent fuel to be put in some sort of battery?  

This technology does exist, they're called Betavoltaic Batteries, they use beta emissions from decaying particles.  They arnt very efficient and would need a lot of them to be even remotely usable. 

With that said, Spent Nuclear Fuel does still contain A LOT of energy, but trying to cupture any radiation it produces is rather pointless.  Even trying to heat water or some other medium with this decay heat just isn't worth it. 

Realistically, reprocessing this fuel is our best option currently, which some countries actually do, allowing it to be re-used.  Or we could deploy fast/breeder reactors that can use this spent fuel and produce usable fuel for current reactor types.","I'm not really sure what you're asking here.

Nuclear,'No higher cost energy': nuclear has drained Germany of more than ‚Ç¨1trn to date,"For what it's worth, I'm not really in favour of opening new nuclear reactors, since solar and wind is now cheaper than gas and coal power plants.

However, what Germany has done which is absolutely and patently stupid, was shut down nuclear power plants literally decades ahead of their planned decommission, and having to rely more on coal and natural gas powerplants to fill the void from the perfectly-functional nuclear power plants they shut down.

Had they simply kept the nuclear reactors open for the rest of their planned life and built up solar and wind as fast as possible, they could have kept a far greener grid without needing to rely more on coal and gas.

So yeah, I like the idea of nuclear, I'm a big fan of the CANDU reactor (using unenriched uranium, cannot be used to make nuclear weapons, can be used to make medical isotopes, easy to maintain and service, fewer radioactive wastes, can use radioactive waste from light water reactors to burn them up a 2nd time, etc) but I recognize it's just a very expensive source of energy that cannot compete with wind and solar.

Had they simply kept the nuclear reactors open for the rest of their planned life and built up solar and wind as fast as possible, they could have kept a far greener grid without needing to rely more on coal and gas.

So yeah, I like the idea of nuclear, I'm a big fan of the CANDU reactor (using unenriched uranium, cannot be used to make nuclear weapons, can be used to make medical isotopes, easy to maintain and service, fewer radioactive wastes, can use radioactive waste from light water reactors to burn them up a 2nd time, etc) but I recognize it's just a very expensive source of energy that cannot compete with wind and solar.

Nuclear,The 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change,"Points 2 and 4 to 7 are totally invalid, as they relate to the supposed dangers of nuclear power. Nuclear is and has always been the safest of any energy source we have.

**More people have died from installing solar panels than have died from nuclear disasters.** For every TWh of energy produced, 0.04 people die from nuclear power, and about 155,000TWh of energy is produced globally every year.  That means in a year, only **6200 people die** from **nuclear energy** production, **68200 people** **die** from falling off rooftops while installing **solar panels**, and **15,500,000 die** from **coal** mining and air pollution  [(I got the figures from this site)](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html). Nuclear power beats every other source in deaths per TWh produced.

Here I address the points in that article:

* 2. The cost would soon be outweighed by the amount of energy it can produce. It is much cheaper than other renewables.
* 4. Meltdowns happen extremely rarely and usually aren't much of a danger due modern technology.
* 5. The mining is much safer than coal, no humans actually go into uranium mines, acid is flushed down pipes to dissolve the uranium.
* 6. I haven't really look into the CO2 cost of nuclear plants, but I can guarantee that the ratio between the energy it produced and its CO2 cost is better than most of the other sources.
* 7. The waste from nuclear power is only a few meters cubed, compare that to the literal kilometres cubed of CO2 we dump into the atmosphere from fossil fuels. Solar panels take up huge amounts of area to produce little energy and hydroelectricity requires vast amounts of land to be flooded.

Nuclear power is the **most practical energy source** we can use to prevent a climate disaster in the next century. Other renewables  are too costly, take up too much area and are often inconsistent.

Nuclear,The 7 reasons why nuclear energy is not the answer to solve climate change,"Sorry to break it to you but some of this is factually wrong.

The most blatant thing is the cost comparisons. The idea that wind and solar are way cheaper than Nuclear is, just, completely wrong, and it's an idea that's being spread by people who don't understand *anything* to do with the science.

All the claims that wind and solar are way cheaper than nuclear are dependent on KW/H production. On pure numbers it looks fine from the outside. They produce twice as much KW/H per dollar!

Problem is, this doesn't account for the fact that the sun doesn't shine half the day, and the wind isn't blowing all the time.

Yeah, on pure KW/H, solar is cheaper. The sun also doesn't shine at night time. So you have to take that into account by roughly doubling whatever estimate you have for your solar cost. (Because in order to even have electricity at night time, it has to be stored somehow, or just come from a different source).

That means after taking this into account, nuclear and solar/wind are actually fairly closely priced.","Sorry to break it to you but some of this is factually wrong.

Nuclear,Nuclear energy is the safest energy source. The statistics never lie!,"Renewables are the future.  Oil, coal, and fissionable material will eventually run out regardless of the vested interests and the politicians they influence (own).

The problem is that renewables can't support our current lifestyles (pun not intended but welcomed), so we have to make a choice as to what will fill the gaps until they take over.  If we go with coal and/or natural gas, in 20 to 50 years when renewables own the day, we can mothball the old plants and move on.

If we go with nuclear, in 20 to 50 years we can mothball the old plants and then spend considerable resources dealing with the tons and tons of deadly nuclear waste.

There's also the complacency factor.  You really want to shut down coal as soon as possible because it's dumping carbon into the air, so there's motivation to get things done with clean energy sources.

With nuclear, you kind of forget about it until something goes horribly, horribly wrong as things have a way of eventually doing.  Nuclear advocates claim how the next generation of plants are so much better than the previous generation that they're virtually fail-safe.  I'm sure if we had access to the debates on nuclear from 40 years ago, they would have said the exact same thing.

When Fukushima and Chernobyl were built, I doubt you'll find experts from the time saying that, while these plants are a little dodgy, the ones coming in forty years will be perfectly safe.  No, they said those old plants were perfectly safe *then* the same way they're saying the new ones are now. (And they were mostly right, just as their future predictions will be *mostly* right.)

Lastly, old energy won't suddenly just disappear.  It will likely linger on for decades as a backup source of power.  Of coal, gas, oil, and nuclear sitting there rusting away, it's easy to see how the first three are preferable to the last (if you're reasonably objective).","Renewables are the future.

I have nothing against nuclear. I think in theory it's the most amazing source of power, but in practice it's just too expensive.

On the other you have a technology that's getting ever more expensive and falling behind in many aspects as time passes. 

Even if we were to subsidize it (more than what we have by creating government-funded waste zones and by having the government insure the plants) it's still not dispatchable, meaning it has to keep on generating even if power prices fall to $0.

Nuclear,"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.","So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

First, reactors can be shut down almost instantaneously. This is for safety. They do keep producing about 8% of their heat though after shut down for about a day. This is removed by, usually, just bleeding steam to the turbine generators, but there are backup methods to this, again, for safety.

A small-ish portion of a nuclear power plant's daily operating cost comes from fuel consumption. A huge portion of the daily operating cost for fossil fuel plants come from fuel consumption. So it's not very cost effective to shut down a nuclear reactor.

As for how long it takes to start up and shut down nuclear plants, it does take awhile if you want to avoid emergency methods. But this is something that was designed in to allow the plants to operate with lower enrichment and large size. If you have a plant designed differently, like with a smaller size, this allows rapid changes in load. Rapid changes in load may become more desired now that renewables are a wide-scale thing. This allows nuclear plants to quickly adapt to changing demand profiles caused by wind and solar variations while still keeping energy green.

Basically, small size nuclear plants are a green solution to make up for the gaps needed to be filled by changing renewable power production.

As for the excess power produced. France just needs to invite companies in that have needs for energy but can take advantage of low grid demand. For example, turning seawater into pure water is energy intensive, but you could only switch those on during peak solar hours. Same thing for producing H2 and O2 gas from H2O. Same thing for producing cryogenic liquids. Same thing for smelting metals (although, I'm not 100% sure about that one). Basically, there are lots of industries that can now pop up in France to take advantage of this negative energy cost.","So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

Precious little space has been given to the detailed reasons *why* the German government is going down this path but there is one quote which alludes to why this is happening;

>‚ÄúThe gas storage tanks must be full by winter,‚Äù Robert Habeck, Germany‚Äôs economy minister and a member of the Green Party, said in June. ‚ÄúThat is our top priority.‚Äù

The plan here is to quickly recommission some coal-fired power plants to temporarily take over from gas-fired plants so that the gas can be used for heating.

The key words there being 'quickly' and 'temporary'. 

You don't just pop down to the local nuclear reactors and mash the ""on"" switch but you can much more quickly get a coal plant up and running. Important when you have a very hard deadline approaching. They can't wait years to get nuclear plants running for a problem which is already happening (gas supplies from the Nord are already off).

The other aspect is 'temporary'. This is just to take load off the operating gas power plants to get through winter and the desire is to shut them off just as quickly. Easy with coal.

Also worth considering the amounts of energy we are discussing. 

Energy from operating gas plants contribute around 89.0 bilion kWh / year (15% of gross energy production). A fair bit greater than the 69.0b kWh from nuclear but a *fraction* of the 236.7b kWh from renewables.

Nobody likes coal, coal is the worst. But in this extreme case the options are limited and coal is sadly the most viable option right now - but it isn't the only option.

What doesn't get reported in low-rate articles like this is that Germany has also brought forward their renewable target of 100% by 2035, and all onshore renewables capacity targets for 2030 have been increased (Nov 2021, ""Easter Package"").  


So in addition to the hard choice of coal to take over from gas they are also deploying as much renewables as possible to accelerate a carbon neutral future.","It really isn't confounding at all and Bryan Walsh might know the reasons why if he actually did some investigation.

Nobody likes coal, coal is the worst. But in this extreme case the options are limited and coal is sadly the most viable option right now - but it isn't the only option.

What doesn't get reported in low-rate articles like this is that Germany has also brought forward their renewable target of 100% by 2035, and all onshore renewables capacity targets for 2030 have been increased (Nov 2021, ""Easter Package"").

Nuclear,France Faces ‚ÄòSubstantial‚Äô Costs If Renewables Wipe Out Nuclear,"[1]

(Bloomberg) -- France faces ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù costs and technical challenges if it wants to replace almost all its aging nuclear plants with renewable energy by 2050, the International Energy Agency and the country‚Äôs grid operator said Wednesday.

In a report commissioned by the French government, the IEA and Reseau de Transport d‚ÄôElectricite highlight the need to scale up new technologies and adapt the legal framework to ensure that a network dominated by variable wind and solar generation remains reliable at all times.

The government is targeting a power mix that‚Äôs about 35% wind and solar in 2035, up from about 10% last year. While the grid can cope with that, France will need more backup production and energy storage if that share is going to expand much further, the report showed. The country must also consider potential public opposition to large wind and solar farms and new power lines.

‚ÄúAll the costs associated with a high share of renewables, including the costs of storage, demand-side flexibility‚Äù and grid development, ‚Äúmight be substantial in France after 2035,‚Äù the IEA and RTE said in the report.

State-controlled Electricite de France SA currently has 56 nuclear power stations in operation, with a production capacity of 61 gigawatts, typically producing almost three-quarters of the country‚Äôs output. It plans to shut a dozen plants by 2035, and most of the rest by 2050.

While President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of building new reactors to replace some of those retiring, he has deferred a decision until after 2022‚Äôs presidential election. Some opposition parties, such as the Greens, are against new atomic plants, pointing to rising costs at EDF‚Äôs current nuclear projects in France and the U.K., as well as environmental risks associated with operating the the generators and storing spent fuel.","[1]

Nuclear,"I'm anti-nuclear, because these are the only arguments I know. Please enlighten me on the ""pro"" position.","I definitely *wouldn't* rule out nuclear as an option for future energy generation.

The best argument I've heard suggests that nuclear capacity should be maintained at its current rate. In other words, new nuclear reactors should only be built to replace old reactors that close down. This should help maintain uranium reserves, although as the supply of uranium becomes less plentiful and harder to extract the cost of using it will go up. It also should help finding suitable sites for new stations, since in many cases they can be built in the same location as the reactor they're due to replace.

Most of the problems with nuclear - safety risks, waste disposal, construction over-runs - are engineering problems that have known solutions. Unfortunately, these solutions don't come cheap. However, putting in place a suitable renewable energy network that can handle baseload demand could be similarly expensive. Nuclear generation will benefit from the rising cost of carbon (just as renewables will) and may be a more attractive option in the next few years.

In the UK, the Scottish parliament has ruled out building any new nuclear reactors. This makes sense, since Scotland has ample opportunity for wind, wave and tidal energy generation. A big majority of the UK's renewable energy targets are likely to come from Scotland. The south of the country is less fortunate, and it also happens to be where energy demand is highest. Siting new nuclear stations close to areas of high demand will mean fewer transmission losses. Unfortunately, that means more additional costs due to the higher land value.

A few caveats. Before any new nuclear reactors are built, a thorough study should be done of all the costs (and emissions) involved over the entire life cycle of the plant, especially with regards to decomissioning old reactors. This will allow a fair and honest comparison to be made between nuclear power and the alternatives. Plans should be in place for suitable disposal of waste - most of the UKs nuclear waste is still in temporary storage waiting permanent storage in a facility that has yet to get off the drawing board, which is a disgrace.

Although I'd put wind, solar, hydro and tidal energy before nuclear given the choice, I've a feeling that the shift in thinking to enable our emissions targets to be met will be too much to rely on renewables alone. Even though you're not looking to make the comparison with coal power, there may not turn out to be much choice.

For any energy system based on renewables there is inherent intermittency in energy production.

In order to mitigate the intermittency, we need energy generation that is easy to ramp production up or down, for example nuclear or gas.

Nuclear,We desperately need nuclear energy powering mass electric transportation; the Eurostar train is about as carbon-intensive per kilometer as walking,"I agree with your point and I was concerned about the nuclear waste generated by reactors. But, I changed my view after I attended a talk about 'Molten Salt Reactor - MSR' by Seaborg technologies CEO Troels sch√∂nfeld.

Basically, they have made / conceptualised a way of making MSR smaller, safer and cheaper than conventional nuclear reactors. By doing this, they hope to capture a part of the market for energy production by making it competitive / cheaper than coal production by 2025.

The cherry on top is that they want to process nuclear waste. This is from their website: "" In the CMSR (Compact Molten Salt Reactor), the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant. This provides significant safety benefits.

If the fuel salt should ever come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and turn into solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself.

The reactor will operate at near-atmospheric pressures and cannot overheat due to a frozen salt plug, that melt and drain the core to cooled tanks before damage can occur.""

The computer in our pocket would have done nothing to mitigate Chernobyl which resulted from plant staff deliberately circumventing safety systems to see how the plant would react to a condition that relied on turbine driven safety systems which are not primary for that purpose and when they realized they had an overheating core dumped cold water in that resulted in a steam and chemical reaction, not nuclear, that blew the lid off 

TMI wouldn‚Äôt have happened if operating staff hadn‚Äôt shut off a safety system because they had not been properly trained and plant instruments suggested a different issue.

The cost to build has always been an issue but many problems didn‚Äôt arise from bad designs but from poorly constructed things. Early in my career, for example, plants were required to perform inspections on hangars used to support safety related systems. What happened was when drilling into rebar reinforced concrete the drill would not advance the depth required by the design and pipe fitters would cut off the end to not need to drill a new hole and fix the one in the wrong places. Shortened anchors didn‚Äôt meet specifications and plants were down until they were fixed. Not bad design but construction quality control was the issue. There are many instances I could convey. 

So the public only hears plants are down (unreliable) without understanding the real issue which is companies trying to compete in spite of not being spec. (Catch me if you can)

France Nationalized nuclear power and the US Navy doesn‚Äôt have the budget constraints commercial plants have so it‚Äôs a good comparison.

Trans-continental grids will help wind even out, but up to a point and the scale of investment and complexity is mind boggling.

Energy storage is of course critical, but you can't reach 100% renewable with it in any imaginable time scale. Pumped hydro are the only means of storing energy in relevant scale, but they won't cut it either. We have hundreds or maybe thousands of those lakes/generators/pumps running currently, globally. For bridgjng the summer-winter storage needs, we would need about 3 orders of magnitude more. Yes, possibly millions new artificial lakes with electric plants. Basically, unimaginable amount.

So we can either keep burning fossils and try to catch their CO2 (not very practical and possibly impossible for net zero) or go more into nuclear, which will be very expensive and politically challenging. Or we can hope for startrek-level scientific discoveries while we pump carbon into the atmosphere.

Let that sink in: we either go nuclear, or we keep heating up the planet in the forseeable future.","Nuclear will be absolutely crucial to achieve net zero CO2 emissions.

Nuclear,How much of a role is nuclear likely to play going forward?,"Depends on the country. China is building nuclear more successfully than anyone else at the moment.

In the rest of the world, it‚Äôs too expensive politically and financially, and SMRs don‚Äôt seem to be very small, modular, or real at this point.

Designed to fail-safe, passive cooling systems and a 30 year lifespan plus they're easier to refurbish/ refuel/ replace mean these could be the future of Nuclear energy.  
It'd also solve an issue we are currently facing with Ukraine. If under threat, the reactors can be disconnected and moved out of hot-zones. They could then be reconnected at back-up sites and can begin providing power again.   


And you're right on the waste front. Some of the newer reactor designs use current reactor waste products and extract as much energy out of the material as possible. Reprocessing of nuclear fuels could mean we get so much more out of them AND we're left with less volatile waste that also has a far, far shorter half-life (as little as 100 years compared to the 10,000 or so years of current designs).   


Oh and it's almost impossible to have these reactors make fissile material (that goes into nuclear warheads) so they wouldn't make THAT issue any more worse than it already is.

- Decentralized, flexible power is the way of the future. Massive centralized power plants that take a decade to permit and build, must run for several decades to pay off (while costs of other energy sources are decreasing steadily), then take decades to decommission, are bad (inflexible, single point of failure, slow to deploy, hard to upgrade, a bad financial gamble).  And they are excellent targets for terrorists or natural disasters.

- If something goes wrong with a nuclear plant, sometimes the result is catastrophic (plant totally ruined, surrounding area evacuated for hundreds of years). With renewables, only failure of a huge hydro dam is remotely comparable.

- Cost of power from renewables is less than cost of power from nuclear, and the gap is widening.  Renewables-plus-storage will be cheaper than nuclear soon.

- Similarly, new-design nuclear such as thorium or fusion won't be ready any time soon, and won't be price-competitive with renewables by the time (if any) they are available.

- Note that I am NOT making any argument based on average safety.  Nuclear plants are quite safe and clean until something unusual goes wrong.  They are safer than having people install solar panels on rooftops, or letting a coal plant pour pollution into the atmosphere.  Although I'm sure mining for nuclear fuel carries some safety risks, as does mining coal or drilling for gas.

We still have to keep using existing nuclear for a while, but we shouldn't invest any new money in nuclear.  Put the money in renewables, storage, non-crop carbon-neutral bio-fuels, etc.

Fessenheim produced annually 11679 GWh of electricy with 2 medium-large reactors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fessenheim_Nuclear_Power_Plant)

To produce 1MWh of electricity per year with solar panel you'll need around 8 m^2 of solar panel (https://www.lepanneausolaire.net/comment-calculer-puissance-d-installation.php)

So to produce as much as good old Fessenheim you'll need around 100 km^2 of solar panel, the surface area of the city of Paris covered by solar panel with no spaces in between

BTW a solar panel is approx 3kg (without framing) per m^2 so we are talking about 300000 tonnes (~600 TGV) of electronic waste to recycle after the 25-30 years life expectancy of the solar panels.

In comparison a large nuclear reactor produces around 25-30 tonnes of used fuel annually (https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-wastes/radioactive-wastes-myths-and-realities.aspx) so Fessenheim would have produced 1250-1800 tonnes of spend fuel during that time, most of which is actually recycled in la Hague, close to 300 time less in weight. Sure electronic waste do not result in nuclear waste, only good old heavy metal and chemical waste, but still toxic waste you wouldn't want in your backyard that will need to be disposed of safely.","The big misunderstanding for people comparing nuclear to renewable is scale, people underestimate how much a nuclear powerplant produces and therefore overestimate the negatives compared to the ones of other energy sources.

Solar,"I'm anti-nuclear, because these are the only arguments I know. Please enlighten me on the ""pro"" position.","I definitely *wouldn't* rule out nuclear as an option for future energy generation.

The best argument I've heard suggests that nuclear capacity should be maintained at its current rate. In other words, new nuclear reactors should only be built to replace old reactors that close down. This should help maintain uranium reserves, although as the supply of uranium becomes less plentiful and harder to extract the cost of using it will go up. It also should help finding suitable sites for new stations, since in many cases they can be built in the same location as the reactor they're due to replace.

Most of the problems with nuclear - safety risks, waste disposal, construction over-runs - are engineering problems that have known solutions. Unfortunately, these solutions don't come cheap. However, putting in place a suitable renewable energy network that can handle baseload demand could be similarly expensive. Nuclear generation will benefit from the rising cost of carbon (just as renewables will) and may be a more attractive option in the next few years.

In the UK, the Scottish parliament has ruled out building any new nuclear reactors. This makes sense, since Scotland has ample opportunity for wind, wave and tidal energy generation. A big majority of the UK's renewable energy targets are likely to come from Scotland. The south of the country is less fortunate, and it also happens to be where energy demand is highest. Siting new nuclear stations close to areas of high demand will mean fewer transmission losses. Unfortunately, that means more additional costs due to the higher land value.

A few caveats. Before any new nuclear reactors are built, a thorough study should be done of all the costs (and emissions) involved over the entire life cycle of the plant, especially with regards to decomissioning old reactors. This will allow a fair and honest comparison to be made between nuclear power and the alternatives. Plans should be in place for suitable disposal of waste - most of the UKs nuclear waste is still in temporary storage waiting permanent storage in a facility that has yet to get off the drawing board, which is a disgrace.

Although I'd put wind, solar, hydro and tidal energy before nuclear given the choice, I've a feeling that the shift in thinking to enable our emissions targets to be met will be too much to rely on renewables alone. Even though you're not looking to make the comparison with coal power, there may not turn out to be much choice.

Solar,France Faces ‚ÄòSubstantial‚Äô Costs If Renewables Wipe Out Nuclear,"[1]

(Bloomberg) -- France faces ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù costs and technical challenges if it wants to replace almost all its aging nuclear plants with renewable energy by 2050, the International Energy Agency and the country‚Äôs grid operator said Wednesday.

In a report commissioned by the French government, the IEA and Reseau de Transport d‚ÄôElectricite highlight the need to scale up new technologies and adapt the legal framework to ensure that a network dominated by variable wind and solar generation remains reliable at all times.

The government is targeting a power mix that‚Äôs about 35% wind and solar in 2035, up from about 10% last year. While the grid can cope with that, France will need more backup production and energy storage if that share is going to expand much further, the report showed. The country must also consider potential public opposition to large wind and solar farms and new power lines.

‚ÄúAll the costs associated with a high share of renewables, including the costs of storage, demand-side flexibility‚Äù and grid development, ‚Äúmight be substantial in France after 2035,‚Äù the IEA and RTE said in the report.

State-controlled Electricite de France SA currently has 56 nuclear power stations in operation, with a production capacity of 61 gigawatts, typically producing almost three-quarters of the country‚Äôs output. It plans to shut a dozen plants by 2035, and most of the rest by 2050.

While President Emmanuel Macron has spoken in favor of building new reactors to replace some of those retiring, he has deferred a decision until after 2022‚Äôs presidential election. Some opposition parties, such as the Greens, are against new atomic plants, pointing to rising costs at EDF‚Äôs current nuclear projects in France and the U.K., as well as environmental risks associated with operating the the generators and storing spent fuel.","[1]

The referenced article seemed a little biased, so I thought I would look a bit deeper. I still don't feel I know enough but it's nice to see his reasoning.

***I am returning*** *Senate Bill 137 4 without my signature. This bill requires the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), by July 1, 2025, to revise electric rate tariffs for customers in multi-unit residential and nonresidential buildings and public schools with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on their property to allow for account-level netting.*

*California has provided policy and financial support for the customer solar PV market over the last two decades. Support that created the largest customer solar PV market in the country. Given the market's exponential growth and significant cost declines in solar PV systems, it is appropriate and prudent to realign the subsidies provided to customers who choose to install these systems at the expense of customers without solar PV systems.* 

*This is why the CPUC facilitated a robust, public decision-making process over the last several years to revise the applicable electric rate tariffs that provide these rate subsidies to customers with solar PV systems. The revisions adopted by the CPUC from this process focused on aligning these rate subsidies with the measurable value these systems provide to the electric grid and towards furthering the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. This endeavor stems from the growing need to address the affordability of electric bills for all customers.* 

*While I support the continued growth of the customer solar PV market, this bill would compound the challenge of electric bill affordability by overturning a key component of a recent CPUC decision adopting these alignment changes. Specifically, this bill would increase the amount that most customers would pay for their own electric service to provide a rate subsidy to certain customers, and public schools, that install solar PV systems on their property.* ***For these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.***","Here is his veto message if you're curious why.

The Japanese  government has been promoting to use domestic species, Japanese cedar,  for wood usage by providing several forest-related industries with a  large amount of subsidies.

Now as a result, many forests are  harvested due to the increased demand for wood biomass. Many of those  areas have not been replanted. You can see many bare lands in the  Japanese mountains.

Solar,"Electricity prices in France turn negative as renewable energy floods the grid, nuclear plants sometimes shut down.","So I think there are some misconceptions about shutting down nuclear reactors and how bad that is.

First, reactors can be shut down almost instantaneously. This is for safety. They do keep producing about 8% of their heat though after shut down for about a day. This is removed by, usually, just bleeding steam to the turbine generators, but there are backup methods to this, again, for safety.

A small-ish portion of a nuclear power plant's daily operating cost comes from fuel consumption. A huge portion of the daily operating cost for fossil fuel plants come from fuel consumption. So it's not very cost effective to shut down a nuclear reactor.

As for how long it takes to start up and shut down nuclear plants, it does take awhile if you want to avoid emergency methods. But this is something that was designed in to allow the plants to operate with lower enrichment and large size. If you have a plant designed differently, like with a smaller size, this allows rapid changes in load. Rapid changes in load may become more desired now that renewables are a wide-scale thing. This allows nuclear plants to quickly adapt to changing demand profiles caused by wind and solar variations while still keeping energy green.

Basically, small size nuclear plants are a green solution to make up for the gaps needed to be filled by changing renewable power production.

As for the excess power produced. France just needs to invite companies in that have needs for energy but can take advantage of low grid demand. For example, turning seawater into pure water is energy intensive, but you could only switch those on during peak solar hours. Same thing for producing H2 and O2 gas from H2O. Same thing for producing cryogenic liquids. Same thing for smelting metals (although, I'm not 100% sure about that one).

Solar,"Sorry, we can‚Äôt have renewables because they work...too...well...? ü§î","Hot take, but let's not oversimplify the issue.  Distributed solar (ie, rooftop) is referred to as ""grid edge"" power because it's produced out on the edge of the utility's distribution network (power lines, etc).  There are a lot of great things about this, such a reduced transmission losses, but there are also downsides.

Solar energy is (obviously) produced in a cyclical fashion, dependent on the availability of sunlight.  But electricity consumption is not based on the availability of sunlight, it's based on users.  When production and consumption don't perfectly align, the utility needs a way to balance supply and demand.  Batteries are one way to do this, but at the scale required by a municipal utility this isn't a realistic solution (yet?).  Instead, they rely on electricity generation that can be scaled to demand, such as a fossil-fuel based peaker plant.  These days, that's probably natural gas.  Wind, hydro and nuclear are not good peaker plants, because they can't be turned on and off quickly.

However, even fossil fuel based electricity generation needs to be ""on"" for long enough to be commercially viable.  When excess solar energy drives electricity rates low or into negative territory, it makes it impossible for a fossil fuel-based power plant to remain online/in business.  Now, you might be saying ""great, that's what we want!""  Except without this option to smooth out unequal electricity supply and demand, we've now created a power distribution system where there is NO power available when there are fluctuations in demand.  That is to say, brownouts and blackouts.

I don't believe this is an insurmountable problem, or one that should discourage the development of new small-scale solar installations.  As it stands, consumption far outstrips demand and it is rare for on-site renewables to produce significantly more power than is used on-site.  However it is a legitimate concern that requires careful implementation of large-scale solar power while utilities transition into fossil-fuel-free solutions to even power distribution.  Incidentally, all this relates to the arguments about net metering also, but that's another topic.","Hot take, but let's not oversimplify the issue.

1 acre = 4,046m\^2.  At 22% efficiency, that is  890 KW of solar.   At 20% capacity factor that will make 1560 MWh/ year.

A Model 3 uses  198 Wh/km.   1560 MWh/198Wh/km = 7.88 million Kms.   Lets see you beat that growing corn to make ethanol to burn in an ICE vehicle.

Solar,I need help to maximise autoconsuption of solar energy,"that is very interesting project. I am looking into something like that, only my system is lot smaller. 

Is there is some kind of sensor/meter that can measure solar radiance and then turn on a relay that can control an appliance like a water heater? My growatt SPF 5000 Inverter seem not to have that option, it simply float charges the battery with a small current/wattage and unless you put the load on it you do not know how much energy it receives from the solar array. 

I have an off grid system and i do not wish to use the energy from the battery banks for big appliances like water heater, I rather use the energy from solar array when there is enough of it to run the water heater.  



Here is an example how I think that solution should work;  if my solar array produces over 1.4KW at any given time then solar relay/sensor will turn on the water heater that uses 1.2KW. That way solar panel array produces enough energy to run the water heater without taking some of the power from the  battery array. Consequently,  if current solar array output drops below 1.4KW then solar sensor/relay turns off the heater until solar conditions improve enough so that water heater can run purely of the solar array.

Solar,Question about the costs of nuclear energy,"Unfortunately, energy markets are complex and the most immediate conclusions made by the layperson are generally wrong. I've previously worked as an energy analyst and my background is engineering.

>LCOE

LCOE is the cost the generator must sell electricity at to break even. It is a figure that varies from its many inputs, will vary region to region and is aimed at investors and businesses. Hence, it almost always includes subsidies which in this case means lots of subsidies for renewables and very few for nuclear.

On top of this, as it's simply a figure of how much a generators must earn to break even, it does not include external costs (i.e. a major component of end-user costs). In the case of variable renewables this means storage and/or backup. These costs are not immediately visible, but when these subsidies and external costs are included, the cost for a nuclear power grid is actually cheaper than a renewable grid in most cases. This was explored in the peer reviewed MIT report [The Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World](http://energy.mit.edu/research/future-nuclear-energy-carbon-constrained-world/). 

The short version: backup sufficient to meet grid reliability standards is very expensive and even using outrageous western nuclear power costs, nuclear is still cheaper than that.

>Second argument

His argument is nonsense sprinkled in with some reality.

Yes, running nuclear power plants intermittently as variable renewable output goes up and down would would be stupid and expensive... But if you have enough nuclear capacity to back up your wind production, why the fuck would you build renewables? What point would be served when you already have a low CO2 source of power?

His entire argument is that renewables *must* be built, come hell or high water, and that everything else must be built around them.

Solar,Question about the costs of nuclear energy,"A lot to unwrap here.

First and foremost it must be understood that LCOE not a measurement of utility, it is loved by those that support renewables because it does not take into account the ancillary cost of variable renewable energy (VRE) which include the need for backup, most often in the form of natural gas generation.

LCOE also does not address the issue of the amount of energy any given installation can produce. A low cost per MW hr  is somewhat meaningless if the quantity being produced does not meet needs.

You are right, it would be ludicrous to build nuclear plants to support VRE - however the solution to that is not build VRE at all. What would be the point if nuclear plants could provide a constant and reliable source of electricity?

Cost effective energy storage is nowhere near as close as many make it out to be. Yes the cost of Li technology has dropped to nearly tenfold to US$156/kWh from what it started as, but that fact in and of itself is no guarantee it will fall to the US$20/kWh it needs to be. This is particularly a concern if  pressure starts to build on the raw material inputs. Furthermore as it relates to decarbonizing the transportation sector, the maximum theoretical potential of advanced lithium-ion batteries is still only about 6 percent of crude oil.

But what of other technologies that show up in the press time to time, surely one of them will be better? No. First there is no guarantee any of these will scale.  One can, however, use thermodynamics to calculate the upper limits of what‚Äôs possible for electrochemical based storage and when we do this, it becomes clear that these technologies will never compete with combustion of liquid fuels on energy density.

Energy density is also the major difficulty with hydrogen and while processes exist to use it and captured CO2 to make synfuels, this itself is very lossy and cannot be done effectively with VRE only energy inputs.","A lot to unwrap here.

Previous studies, however, omitted the fact that renewable energy systems such as wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV) yield a high-quality energy carrier: electricity. Electricity end-uses often have higher efficiencies than those of fossil-fuel-based carriers.

- We don't think we can completely stop all fossil fuel use by 2050 _while continuing economic growth_ and allowing increased standards of living in poorer countries - but it can be massively drawn down. Coal must stop and all other fossil fuel use must be abated with carbon capture.

- The vast majority of new primary energy production will come from solar and wind, but other renewables and nuclear power will also play a smaller role.

- Insulation, reduction of food waste, reduced need for transport, and other draw-downs of demand will offset part of the continued increase in electricity need. (Personal note: All these reductions in demand are incredible cost-savers, and that they're not already being done everywhere is a failure of our political and economic system.)

Wind and Solar power are the main culprits behind the Texas grid being less reliable than it should be. 

Pointing the finger at the failures of the Natural Gas pipeline infrastructure is a valid point. The pipelines would have had issues whether or not renewables expanded to the extent they have today and there is no getting around that. 

Still, this ignores the fact that fossil fuel generation has been neglected for the past quarter century due to aggressive green policy agendas that seek to move into a carbon neutral future overnight. 

The massive expansion of renewable generation in West Texas over the past 15 years has come at the expense of more reliable forms of generation and it has been accomplished in an anti competitive fashion, through excessive subsidies and related incentives. 

It‚Äôs really a matter of simple economics and it has been playing out for more than a decade. This extreme weather event was the straw that broke the camels back.

Power companies will bankrupt themselves weatherizing their facilities that cost ~$50Mw to run due to fuel prices, because they are forced to run these fossil fuel units unprofitably as they are paid the same auction clearing Mw price as renewable generation, who‚Äôs marginal costs are ~$5Mw thanks to excessive subsidies. 


Had reliability of the grid been taken as seriously as the reduction of emissions, through appropriate economic incentives, there would have been more Nuclear Units and Fossil Fuel based generation online, with the ability to increase generation immediately to match the real time demand spike, leading to fewer outages and a more resilient grid overall.
