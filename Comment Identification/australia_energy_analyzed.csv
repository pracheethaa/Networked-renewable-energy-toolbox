Wind,"VihanWhat is a solar feed-in tariff? Many Victorians now know about solar systems for households. But what is a solar feed-in tariff, and how could it benefit your energy bills? 
Find the full article here: https://brnw.ch/21wLjhC

Australia is a global leader in solar power. The Clean Energy Council reports that rooftop solar now accounts for 11.2 per cent of Australia’s total electricity supply, with an estimated one in three households and businesses having installed rooftop solar. That makes solar Australia’s fourth largest source of electricity generation, and its second largest renewable electricity generation behind wind energy.

""It’s clear that Australians are becoming familiar with rooftop solar panels, as well as solar batteries,"" says Greg Edye, General Manager Energy at RACV. ""But solar system owners, and those considering getting one, may be a little more confused on the concept of a solar feed-in tariff. In light of the premium solar feed-in tariff scheme ending this year, it's important to learn about these tariffs and how they can work for you.""","Spent 4 years after getting ours on the roof before we could get anything at all. AUSNET denied our address so we had to go through hoops to get it recognised. There was some crook activity with bogus addresses so they said. Finally got recognised and feed in tariff had been reduced bit by bit ever since, about 3 cents now. I’m not sorry we have solar as it’s better for the environment but wouldn’t be worth the outlay now.","Spent 4 years after getting ours on the roof before we could get anything at all.
